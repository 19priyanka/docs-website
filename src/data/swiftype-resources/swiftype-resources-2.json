      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Note that editing an existing condition can result in resetting its evaluation. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (for example, 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status In order for a NRQL alert condition health status display to function properly, use a FACET clause to scope each signal to a single entity (for example, FACET hostname or FACET appname). Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Condition edits can reset condition evaluation When you edit NRQL alert conditions in some specific ways (detailed below), their evaluations are reset, meaning that any evaluation up until that point is lost, and the evaluation starts over from that point. The two ways this will affect you are: For \"for at least x minutes\" thresholds: because the evaluation window has been reset, there will be a delay of at least x minutes before any violations can be reported. For baseline conditions: the condition starts over again and all baseline learning is lost. The following actions cause an evaluation reset for NRQL conditions: Changing the query Changing the aggregation window, aggregation method, or aggregation delay/timer setting Changing the \"close violations on signal loss\" setting Changing any gap fill settings Changing the baseline direction (if applicable) – higher, lower, or higher/lower Change the threshold value, threshold window, or threshold operator The following actions (along with any other actions not covered in the above list) will not reset the evaluation: Changing the loss of signal time window (expiration duration) Changing the time function (switching \"for at least\" to \"at least once in,\" or vice-versa) Toggling the \"open violation on signal loss\" setting Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Alerts offers NRQL conditions in three threshold types: static, baseline, and outlier. This document explains how the outlier threshold type works, gives some example use cases and NRQL queries, and explains how to create an outlier condition. Important NRQL alerts do not affect Alerts policies for a Synthetic monitor. For example, muting a NRQL alert will not mute a Synthetic monitor's alerts. What is outlier detection? In software development and operations, it is common to have a group consisting of members you expect to behave approximately the same. For example: for servers using a load balancer, the traffic to the servers may go up or down, but the traffic for all the servers should remain in a fairly tight grouping. See outlier detection in action in this NerdBytes video (2:51 minutes). The NRQL alert outlier detection feature parses the data returned by your faceted NRQL query and: Looks for the number of expected groups that you specify Looks for outliers (values deviating from a group) based on the sensitivity and time range you set Additionally, for queries that have more than one group, you can choose to be notified when groups start behaving the same. This visual aid will help you understand the types of situations that will trigger a violation and those that won't. For more on the rules and logic behind this calculation, see Outlier detection rules. Tip Note: this feature does not take into account the past behavior of the monitored values; it looks for outliers only in the currently reported data. For an alert type that takes into account past behavior, see Baseline alerting. Example use cases These use cases will help you understand when to use the outlier threshold type. Note that the outlier feature requires a NRQL query with a FACET clause. Notify if load-balanced servers have uneven workload A load balancer divides web traffic approximately evenly across five different servers. You can set a notification to be sent if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Example query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Notify if load-balanced application has misbehaving instances Application instances behind a load balancer should have similar throughput, error rates, and response times. If an instance is in a bad state, or a load balancer is misconfigured, this will not be the case. Detecting one or two bad app instances using aggregate metrics may be difficult if there is not a significant rise in the overall error rate of the application. You can set a notification for when an app instance’s throughput, error rate, or response time deviates too far from the rest of the group. Example query: SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET host Copy Notify of changes in different environments An application is deployed in two different environments, with ten application instances in each. One environment is experimental and gets more errors than the other. But the instances that are in the same environment should get approximately the same number of errors. You can set a notification for when an instance starts getting more errors than the other instances in the same environment. Also, you can set a notification for when the two environments start to have the same number of errors as each other. Notify for timezone-related changes The number of logged in users for a company is about the same for each of four applications, but varies significantly by each of the three time zones the company operates in. You can set a notification for when any application starts getting more or less traffic from a certain timezone than the other applications. Sometimes the traffic from the different time zones are the same, so you would set up the alert condition to not be notified if the time zone groups overlap. For more details on how this feature works, see Outlier rules and logic. Create an outlier alert condition To create a NRQL alert that uses outlier detection: When creating a condition, under Select a product, select NRQL. For Threshold type, select Outlier. Create a NRQL query with a FACET clause that returns the values you want to alert on. Depending on how the returned values group together, set the Number of expected groups. Adjust the deviation from the center of the group(s) and the duration that will trigger a violation. Optional: Add a warning threshold and set its deviation. Set any remaining available options and save. Rules and logic Here are the rules and logic behind how outlier detection works: Details about alert condition logic After the condition is created, the query is run once every harvest cycle and the condition is applied. Unlike baseline alerts, outlier detection uses no historical data in its calculation; it's calculated using the currently collected data. Alerts will attempt to divide the data returned from the query into the number of groups selected during condition creation. For each group, the approximate average value is calculated. The allowable deviation you have chosen when creating the condition is centered around that average value. If a member of the group is outside the allowed deviation, it produces a violation. If Trigger when groups overlap has been selected, Alerts detects a convergence of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values cannot be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will produce a violation. This type of “overlap” event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Because this feature does not take past behavior into account, data is never considered to \"belong\" to a certain group. For example, a value that switches places with another value wouldn't trigger a violation. Additionally, an entire group that moves together also wouldn't trigger a violation. NRQL query rules and limits The NRQL query must be a faceted query. The number of unique values returned must be 500 or less. If the query returns more than this number of values, the condition won't be created. If the query later returns more than this number after being created, the alert will fail. Zero values for unreturned data When a query returns a set of values, only values that are actually returned are taken into account. If a value is not available for calculation (including if it goes from being collected one harvest cycle to not being collected), it is rendered as a zero and is not considered. In other words, the behavior of unreturned zero values will never trigger violations.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving.

Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow.

Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Alerts conditions provide a sophisticated set of tools for describing when you want to be notified about something that's happened or failed to happen on something you're monitoring. For best results, choose the aggregation method that best matches the way your data arrives. The three aggregation methods are event flow, event timer, and cadence. If you're interested in a conceptual overview, see our doc on streaming alerts, key terms and concepts. What's aggregation? When an application or service is monitored by New Relic, data can arrive in different ways. Some data arrives consistently and predictably, while other data arrives inconsistently and sporadically. Aggregation is how our alerting system gathers data together before analyzing it for exceeding warning or critical threshold levels. Your data is collected as data points in an aggregation window and then turned into a single numeric value. The data points are aggregated based on your NRQL query using methods like sum, average, min, and max, among others. This single numeric value is what's used to evaluate the condition's threshold. Once data has been aggregated, no more data points can be added to it. Our different aggregation methods will help you strike a balance between aggregating your data quickly and waiting for enough data points to arrive. Why it matters With the correct aggregation method, you're more likely to get notifications you care about, while preventing ones you don't. The most important questions to consider when deciding on your aggregation method: How often does my data arrive? How consistently does my data arrive? When data arrives frequently and consistently in a linear way, we recommend using event flow. When data arrives sporadically, inconsistently, and out of order, we recommend using event timer aggregation. When to use event flow With event flow, data is aggregated based on data point timestamps, so it's important that data points arrive in a consistent and linear manner. This aggregation method doesn't work as well for data point timestamps that arrive out of order or with a wide span of time within a short period. Event flow is the default aggregation method, because it applies for the most common use cases. How event flow works Event flow uses data point timestamps to determine when to open and close an aggregation window. For example, if you're using event flow with a 2 minute delay window, then an aggregation window will close when a timestamp arrives that's two minutes later than the last timestamp that was received. A data point with a 12:00pm timestamp arrives. An aggregation window opens. At some point, a 12:03pm data point arrives. Event flow closes the window, excluding the 12:03 data point, and evaluates that closed window against your thresholds. The event flow aggregation window will continue collecting data points until that later timestamp. The later timestamps are what moves the system forward, not the data points themselves. Event flow will wait as long as necessary for the next data point later than your delay setting to arrive, before aggregating the data. Event flow works best for data that arrives frequently and consistently. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the event timer method described below. Event flow use cases Here are some typical event flow use cases: APM agent data. Infrastructure agent data. Any data coming from a 3rd party that comes in frequently and reliably. Most AWS Cloudwatch metrics coming from the AWS Metric Stream (NOT polling). The main exception is that some AWS Cloudwatch data is very infrequent (like S3 volume data) regardless of whether it's streaming or polling and, in that case, you'd use Event timer. When to use event timer Event timer aggregation is based on a timer that counts down when a data point arrives. The timer resets every time a new data point arrives. If the timer counts down before a new data point arrives, event timer aggregates all of the data points received during that time. Event timer is best for alerting on events that happen sporadically and with large gaps of time. How event timer works Errors are a type of event that happens sporadically, unpredictably, and often with large gaps of time. For example, you might have a condition with a query that returns a count of errors. Many minutes may go by without any errors at all, and then suddenly 5 errors arrive within a minute. In this example, event timer would do nothing until the first of the 5 errors arrive. Then it would start the timer, resetting it each time a new error arrives. If the timer countdown reaches 0 without a new error, event timer aggregates the data, and evaluates it against your threshold. Event timer use cases Here are some typical event timer use cases: New Relic usage data. Cloud integration data that is being polled (such as with GCP, Azure, or AWS polling methods). Queries that deliver sparse or infrequent data, such as error counts. Cadence Cadence is our original aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. We recommend that you use one of our other aggregation methods instead. If you're currently using cadence, choose one of the other aggregation methods. Event flow is best for consistent, predictable data points. Event timer is best for inconsistent, sporadic data points. Aggregation and loss of signal Our loss of signal system runs separately from these aggregation methods and settings. If you set your alert condition to open a new violation when your signal is lost for 10 minutes, a loss of signal service watches for data points to arrive. If a new data point fails to arrive within 10 minutes, loss of signal causes a violation to open. For more information on when to use gap filling and loss single, see our forum post on when to use gap filling and loss of signal.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive.

For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see Alerts concepts. What is a violation event? The violation of a condition generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features. Important The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event. Violation event attributes This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in NrAiIncident. BETA FEATURE NrAiIncident is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out! You may be wondering why we're using NrAiIncident as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as \"violations,\" they'll be called \"incidents\" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions. All attributes are available for use in a description. Read about attributes available for muting rules. Attribute Description accountId The ID of the account where the violation occurred. Available for muting rules. aggregationDuration The active condition's aggregation window. closeCause If applicable, what caused the incident to close. Available values: CONDITION_DELETED, POLICY_DELETED, EVALUATOR, EXPIRED, CONDITION_MODIFIED, LOSS_OF_SIGNAL, USER, TARGET_REMOVED, and CONDITION_DISABLED. closeTime If applicable, the timestamp when the incident was closed. closeViolationsOnExpiration If true, open violations on the signal are closed if the signal is lost.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Note that editing an existing condition can result in resetting its evaluation. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (for example, 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status In order for a NRQL alert condition health status display to function properly, use a FACET clause to scope each signal to a single entity (for example, FACET hostname or FACET appname). Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Condition edits can reset condition evaluation When you edit NRQL alert conditions in some specific ways (detailed below), their evaluations are reset, meaning that any evaluation up until that point is lost, and the evaluation starts over from that point. The two ways this will affect you are: For \"for at least x minutes\" thresholds: because the evaluation window has been reset, there will be a delay of at least x minutes before any violations can be reported. For baseline conditions: the condition starts over again and all baseline learning is lost. The following actions cause an evaluation reset for NRQL conditions: Changing the query Changing the aggregation window, aggregation method, or aggregation delay/timer setting Changing the \"close violations on signal loss\" setting Changing any gap fill settings Changing the baseline direction (if applicable) – higher, lower, or higher/lower Change the threshold value, threshold window, or threshold operator The following actions (along with any other actions not covered in the above list) will not reset the evaluation: Changing the loss of signal time window (expiration duration) Changing the time function (switching \"for at least\" to \"at least once in,\" or vice-versa) Toggling the \"open violation on signal loss\" setting Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Configuring incident detection consistently across your entire estate helps you track the overall health of your systems, avoid blindspots, and reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve issues. We know that creating accurate alert conditions is anything but simple. Knowing which metrics to monitor, and setting the thresholds accordingly, is a task that few have the necessary knowledge of both their systems and of New Relic to feel confident executing. This results in teams only applying incident detection practices to a subset of critical services. Good news: New Relic One now has an alert condition recommendation service that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to recommend specific metrics and signals to monitor for your specific entities. You can use the provided recommendations or modify them to fit your specific needs. Here’s how you can add recommended alerts to APM entities that do not currently have alert coverage. Using recommended conditions Go to Services - APM in New Relic Navigator and you’ll see a high-density view of the health of your system. With the traffic-light visual, it’s easy to view which entities are healthy, which entities have violations, and which entities do not have any alerts coverage. If an entity does not have alert coverage, its hexagon will be gray. Recommended conditions helps you automatically add alerts to entities that do not have alerts coverage, those gray hexagons. Select an entity: Click an uncovered entity (gray hexagon). A new option will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click Create alert condition as shown in the image below. Choose a number of recommended conditions. The recommendations will depend on the quality of the tags associated with an entity. The more accurate and informative the tags are, the more precise the recommendations will be. The image below shows a few possible recommendations based on error percentage, Apdex, and response time.

      "body": "Improve your Alerts coverage by implementing the following recommendations and get the most out of your alerts configuration. And check out this video on finding the root cause for an alert (5:01 minutes): Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types.

There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Alerts conditions provide a sophisticated set of tools for describing when you want to be notified about something that's happened or failed to happen on something you're monitoring. For best results, choose the aggregation method that best matches the way your data arrives. The three aggregation methods are event flow, event timer, and cadence. If you're interested in a conceptual overview, see our doc on streaming alerts, key terms and concepts. What's aggregation? When an application or service is monitored by New Relic, data can arrive in different ways. Some data arrives consistently and predictably, while other data arrives inconsistently and sporadically. Aggregation is how our alerting system gathers data together before analyzing it for exceeding warning or critical threshold levels. Your data is collected as data points in an aggregation window and then turned into a single numeric value. The data points are aggregated based on your NRQL query using methods like sum, average, min, and max, among others. This single numeric value is what's used to evaluate the condition's threshold. Once data has been aggregated, no more data points can be added to it. Our different aggregation methods will help you strike a balance between aggregating your data quickly and waiting for enough data points to arrive. Why it matters With the correct aggregation method, you're more likely to get notifications you care about, while preventing ones you don't. The most important questions to consider when deciding on your aggregation method: How often does my data arrive? How consistently does my data arrive? When data arrives frequently and consistently in a linear way, we recommend using event flow. When data arrives sporadically, inconsistently, and out of order, we recommend using event timer aggregation. When to use event flow With event flow, data is aggregated based on data point timestamps, so it's important that data points arrive in a consistent and linear manner. This aggregation method doesn't work as well for data point timestamps that arrive out of order or with a wide span of time within a short period. Event flow is the default aggregation method, because it applies for the most common use cases. How event flow works Event flow uses data point timestamps to determine when to open and close an aggregation window. For example, if you're using event flow with a 2 minute delay window, then an aggregation window will close when a timestamp arrives that's two minutes later than the last timestamp that was received. A data point with a 12:00pm timestamp arrives. An aggregation window opens. At some point, a 12:03pm data point arrives. Event flow closes the window, excluding the 12:03 data point, and evaluates that closed window against your thresholds. The event flow aggregation window will continue collecting data points until that later timestamp. The later timestamps are what moves the system forward, not the data points themselves. Event flow will wait as long as necessary for the next data point later than your delay setting to arrive, before aggregating the data. Event flow works best for data that arrives frequently and consistently. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the event timer method described below. Event flow use cases Here are some typical event flow use cases: APM agent data. Infrastructure agent data. Any data coming from a 3rd party that comes in frequently and reliably. Most AWS Cloudwatch metrics coming from the AWS Metric Stream (NOT polling). The main exception is that some AWS Cloudwatch data is very infrequent (like S3 volume data) regardless of whether it's streaming or polling and, in that case, you'd use Event timer. When to use event timer Event timer aggregation is based on a timer that counts down when a data point arrives. The timer resets every time a new data point arrives. If the timer counts down before a new data point arrives, event timer aggregates all of the data points received during that time. Event timer is best for alerting on events that happen sporadically and with large gaps of time. How event timer works Errors are a type of event that happens sporadically, unpredictably, and often with large gaps of time. For example, you might have a condition with a query that returns a count of errors. Many minutes may go by without any errors at all, and then suddenly 5 errors arrive within a minute. In this example, event timer would do nothing until the first of the 5 errors arrive. Then it would start the timer, resetting it each time a new error arrives. If the timer countdown reaches 0 without a new error, event timer aggregates the data, and evaluates it against your threshold. Event timer use cases Here are some typical event timer use cases: New Relic usage data. Cloud integration data that is being polled (such as with GCP, Azure, or AWS polling methods). Queries that deliver sparse or infrequent data, such as error counts. Cadence Cadence is our original aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. We recommend that you use one of our other aggregation methods instead. If you're currently using cadence, choose one of the other aggregation methods. Event flow is best for consistent, predictable data points. Event timer is best for inconsistent, sporadic data points. Aggregation and loss of signal Our loss of signal system runs separately from these aggregation methods and settings. If you set your alert condition to open a new violation when your signal is lost for 10 minutes, a loss of signal service watches for data points to arrive. If a new data point fails to arrive within 10 minutes, loss of signal causes a violation to open. For more information on when to use gap filling and loss single, see our forum post on when to use gap filling and loss of signal.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Note that editing an existing condition can result in resetting its evaluation. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (for example, 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status In order for a NRQL alert condition health status display to function properly, use a FACET clause to scope each signal to a single entity (for example, FACET hostname or FACET appname). Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Condition edits can reset condition evaluation When you edit NRQL alert conditions in some specific ways (detailed below), their evaluations are reset, meaning that any evaluation up until that point is lost, and the evaluation starts over from that point. The two ways this will affect you are: For \"for at least x minutes\" thresholds: because the evaluation window has been reset, there will be a delay of at least x minutes before any violations can be reported. For baseline conditions: the condition starts over again and all baseline learning is lost. The following actions cause an evaluation reset for NRQL conditions: Changing the query Changing the aggregation window, aggregation method, or aggregation delay/timer setting Changing the \"close violations on signal loss\" setting Changing any gap fill settings Changing the baseline direction (if applicable) – higher, lower, or higher/lower Change the threshold value, threshold window, or threshold operator The following actions (along with any other actions not covered in the above list) will not reset the evaluation: Changing the loss of signal time window (expiration duration) Changing the time function (switching \"for at least\" to \"at least once in,\" or vice-versa) Toggling the \"open violation on signal loss\" setting Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Alerts conditions provide a sophisticated set of tools for describing when you want to be notified about something that's happened or failed to happen on something you're monitoring. For best results, choose the aggregation method that best matches the way your data arrives. The three aggregation methods are event flow, event timer, and cadence. If you're interested in a conceptual overview, see our doc on streaming alerts, key terms and concepts. What's aggregation? When an application or service is monitored by New Relic, data can arrive in different ways. Some data arrives consistently and predictably, while other data arrives inconsistently and sporadically. Aggregation is how our alerting system gathers data together before analyzing it for exceeding warning or critical threshold levels. Your data is collected as data points in an aggregation window and then turned into a single numeric value. The data points are aggregated based on your NRQL query using methods like sum, average, min, and max, among others. This single numeric value is what's used to evaluate the condition's threshold. Once data has been aggregated, no more data points can be added to it. Our different aggregation methods will help you strike a balance between aggregating your data quickly and waiting for enough data points to arrive. Why it matters With the correct aggregation method, you're more likely to get notifications you care about, while preventing ones you don't. The most important questions to consider when deciding on your aggregation method: How often does my data arrive? How consistently does my data arrive? When data arrives frequently and consistently in a linear way, we recommend using event flow. When data arrives sporadically, inconsistently, and out of order, we recommend using event timer aggregation. When to use event flow With event flow, data is aggregated based on data point timestamps, so it's important that data points arrive in a consistent and linear manner. This aggregation method doesn't work as well for data point timestamps that arrive out of order or with a wide span of time within a short period. Event flow is the default aggregation method, because it applies for the most common use cases. How event flow works Event flow uses data point timestamps to determine when to open and close an aggregation window. For example, if you're using event flow with a 2 minute delay window, then an aggregation window will close when a timestamp arrives that's two minutes later than the last timestamp that was received. A data point with a 12:00pm timestamp arrives. An aggregation window opens. At some point, a 12:03pm data point arrives. Event flow closes the window, excluding the 12:03 data point, and evaluates that closed window against your thresholds. The event flow aggregation window will continue collecting data points until that later timestamp. The later timestamps are what moves the system forward, not the data points themselves. Event flow will wait as long as necessary for the next data point later than your delay setting to arrive, before aggregating the data. Event flow works best for data that arrives frequently and consistently. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the event timer method described below. Event flow use cases Here are some typical event flow use cases: APM agent data. Infrastructure agent data. Any data coming from a 3rd party that comes in frequently and reliably. Most AWS Cloudwatch metrics coming from the AWS Metric Stream (NOT polling). The main exception is that some AWS Cloudwatch data is very infrequent (like S3 volume data) regardless of whether it's streaming or polling and, in that case, you'd use Event timer. When to use event timer Event timer aggregation is based on a timer that counts down when a data point arrives. The timer resets every time a new data point arrives. If the timer counts down before a new data point arrives, event timer aggregates all of the data points received during that time. Event timer is best for alerting on events that happen sporadically and with large gaps of time. How event timer works Errors are a type of event that happens sporadically, unpredictably, and often with large gaps of time. For example, you might have a condition with a query that returns a count of errors. Many minutes may go by without any errors at all, and then suddenly 5 errors arrive within a minute. In this example, event timer would do nothing until the first of the 5 errors arrive. Then it would start the timer, resetting it each time a new error arrives. If the timer countdown reaches 0 without a new error, event timer aggregates the data, and evaluates it against your threshold. Event timer use cases Here are some typical event timer use cases: New Relic usage data. Cloud integration data that is being polled (such as with GCP, Azure, or AWS polling methods). Queries that deliver sparse or infrequent data, such as error counts. Cadence Cadence is our original aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. We recommend that you use one of our other aggregation methods instead. If you're currently using cadence, choose one of the other aggregation methods. Event flow is best for consistent, predictable data points. Event timer is best for inconsistent, sporadic data points. Aggregation and loss of signal Our loss of signal system runs separately from these aggregation methods and settings. If you set your alert condition to open a new violation when your signal is lost for 10 minutes, a loss of signal service watches for data points to arrive. If a new data point fails to arrive within 10 minutes, loss of signal causes a violation to open.

Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Note that editing an existing condition can result in resetting its evaluation. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (for example, 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status In order for a NRQL alert condition health status display to function properly, use a FACET clause to scope each signal to a single entity (for example, FACET hostname or FACET appname). Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Condition edits can reset condition evaluation When you edit NRQL alert conditions in some specific ways (detailed below), their evaluations are reset, meaning that any evaluation up until that point is lost, and the evaluation starts over from that point. The two ways this will affect you are: For \"for at least x minutes\" thresholds: because the evaluation window has been reset, there will be a delay of at least x minutes before any violations can be reported. For baseline conditions: the condition starts over again and all baseline learning is lost. The following actions cause an evaluation reset for NRQL conditions: Changing the query Changing the aggregation window, aggregation method, or aggregation delay/timer setting Changing the \"close violations on signal loss\" setting Changing any gap fill settings Changing the baseline direction (if applicable) – higher, lower, or higher/lower Change the threshold value, threshold window, or threshold operator The following actions (along with any other actions not covered in the above list) will not reset the evaluation: Changing the loss of signal time window (expiration duration) Changing the time function (switching \"for at least\" to \"at least once in,\" or vice-versa) Toggling the \"open violation on signal loss\" setting Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence This short video describes the three aggregation method (5:31). Choose your aggregation method If your data arrives consistently and predictably, use event flow. If your data arrives inconsistently and unpredictably, use event timer. Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow Event flow aggregates a window of data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the Event Timer method described below. Event timer Like event flow, event timer will only aggregate data for a given window when data arrives for that window. When a data point arrives for an aggregation window, a timer dedicated to that window starts to count down. If no further data arrives before the timer counts down, the data for that window is aggregated. If more data points arrive before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Alerts conditions provide a sophisticated set of tools for describing when you want to be notified about something that's happened or failed to happen on something you're monitoring. For best results, choose the aggregation method that best matches the way your data arrives. The three aggregation methods are event flow, event timer, and cadence. If you're interested in a conceptual overview, see our doc on streaming alerts, key terms and concepts. What's aggregation? When an application or service is monitored by New Relic, data can arrive in different ways. Some data arrives consistently and predictably, while other data arrives inconsistently and sporadically. Aggregation is how our alerting system gathers data together before analyzing it for exceeding warning or critical threshold levels. Your data is collected as data points in an aggregation window and then turned into a single numeric value. The data points are aggregated based on your NRQL query using methods like sum, average, min, and max, among others. This single numeric value is what's used to evaluate the condition's threshold. Once data has been aggregated, no more data points can be added to it. Our different aggregation methods will help you strike a balance between aggregating your data quickly and waiting for enough data points to arrive. Why it matters With the correct aggregation method, you're more likely to get notifications you care about, while preventing ones you don't. The most important questions to consider when deciding on your aggregation method: How often does my data arrive? How consistently does my data arrive? When data arrives frequently and consistently in a linear way, we recommend using event flow. When data arrives sporadically, inconsistently, and out of order, we recommend using event timer aggregation. When to use event flow With event flow, data is aggregated based on data point timestamps, so it's important that data points arrive in a consistent and linear manner. This aggregation method doesn't work as well for data point timestamps that arrive out of order or with a wide span of time within a short period. Event flow is the default aggregation method, because it applies for the most common use cases. How event flow works Event flow uses data point timestamps to determine when to open and close an aggregation window. For example, if you're using event flow with a 2 minute delay window, then an aggregation window will close when a timestamp arrives that's two minutes later than the last timestamp that was received. A data point with a 12:00pm timestamp arrives. An aggregation window opens. At some point, a 12:03pm data point arrives. Event flow closes the window, excluding the 12:03 data point, and evaluates that closed window against your thresholds. The event flow aggregation window will continue collecting data points until that later timestamp. The later timestamps are what moves the system forward, not the data points themselves. Event flow will wait as long as necessary for the next data point later than your delay setting to arrive, before aggregating the data. Event flow works best for data that arrives frequently and consistently. Caution If you expect your data points to arrive more than 30 minutes apart, please use the event timer method described below. Event flow use cases Here are some typical event flow use cases: APM agent data. Infrastructure agent data. Any data coming from a 3rd party that comes in frequently and reliably. Most AWS Cloudwatch metrics coming from the AWS Metric Stream (NOT polling). The main exception is that some AWS Cloudwatch data is very infrequent (like S3 volume data) regardless of whether it's streaming or polling and, in that case, you'd use Event timer. When to use event timer Event timer aggregation is based on a timer that counts down when a data point arrives. The timer resets every time a new data point arrives. If the timer counts down before a new data point arrives, event timer aggregates all of the data points received during that time. Event timer is best for alerting on events that happen sporadically and with large gaps of time. How event timer works Errors are a type of event that happens sporadically, unpredictably, and often with large gaps of time. For example, you might have a condition with a query that returns a count of errors. Many minutes may go by without any errors at all, and then suddenly 5 errors arrive within a minute. In this example, event timer would do nothing until the first of the 5 errors arrive. Then it would start the timer, resetting it each time a new error arrives. If the timer countdown reaches 0 without a new error, event timer aggregates the data, and evaluates it against your threshold. Event timer use cases Here are some typical event timer use cases: New Relic usage data. Cloud integration data that is being polled (such as with GCP, Azure, or AWS polling methods). Queries that deliver sparse or infrequent data, such as error counts. Cadence Cadence is our original aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. We recommend that you use one of our other aggregation methods instead. If you're currently using cadence, choose one of the other aggregation methods. Event flow is best for consistent, predictable data points. Event timer is best for inconsistent, sporadic data points. Aggregation and loss of signal Our loss of signal system runs separately from these aggregation methods and settings. If you set your alert condition to open a new violation when your signal is lost for 10 minutes, a loss of signal service watches for data points to arrive. If a new data point fails to arrive within 10 minutes, loss of signal causes a violation to open. For more information on when to use gap filling and loss single, see our forum post on when to use gap filling and loss of signal.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Datarobot (formerly Algorithmia) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Datarobot for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

For more information on related features, see our docs on Alerts notification channels, Incident Intelligence destinations, and Proactive Detection notifications. Alerts and Applied Intelligence notification integrations are specific services and platforms you can use to send notifications from New Relic. Integration details Read more about each of our specific notification integrations. Atlassian Jira Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create and update Jira issues. Permissions The required permissions from the Jira API-Token are create, edit, and close tickets. To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira API-Key should have an Admin role. Set up a Jira destination Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced. To create a Jira destination, enter the following information: Destination name: Custom name to identify the destination Jira account endpoint: the URL of the destination User-name: this will be the email address of the user making the connection API token: generated from your Atlassian account Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the test connection button. Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving. Two-way sync You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic-API-KEY) Configure the message template To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Jira message template. Send a test notification You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear. ServiceNow (Incident-Management) Integrate New Relic with ServiceNow Incident-Management and automatically create and update incidents. Roles As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values. For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user and task. A read/write permission to incident To be able to fetch users for the caller column, we required read permissions for the sys_users table. The above permissions can be achieved with the roles personalize_choices, personalize_dictionary, rest_service, itil. Read/Write permissions to the api_key_credentials table is required to enable two-way integration. This can be covered with the roles credentials_admin and discovery_admin. Set up a destination To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information: Destination Name: custom name to identify the destination Domain: the URL of the destination User-name: the name of the user Password: the user name’s password Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the test connection button. Two-way sync You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. Here are some required steps to remember when configuring the two-way integration: Turn on the two-way integration toggle. Open and download this XML file, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML and upload the XML file you downloaded. Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the api_key_credentials. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic Configure the message template Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template. Send a test notification You can see how the ServiceNow incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear. Slack Send notifications-messages to your Slack channels. Prerequisites Your Slack workspace needs to have the New Relic application installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users Set up a Slack destination Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process. On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click Continue. When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions. Clicking `Allow' will redirect you back to the Destination page. Configure the Slack message settings Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process) Send a test notification You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel. Webhook Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like. Set up a webhook destination To create a webhook destination, you need the following: Destination Name: A unique destination name URL: the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed. Authorization mechanism (Optional):. Can be basic authentication or a bearer token Configure the webhook event template Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. The request configuration requires you to: Set a name for the template. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one. Add custom headers (optional). Configure the request’s payload. Customize the webhook payload You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick Variables from the variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook. Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. See Usage examples The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the eventual payload would not form a valid Json, an error will be shown and it won’t be possible to save the template. If the webhook payload conforms a valid Json, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly. Email Send email notifications to users. Configure the email settings Add one or more recipients. Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address. To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, add the full email address. Every recipient will be translated into a 'destination'. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the notifications-log Send a test notification You can send a test notification to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With workflows you control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. What is an issue Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. For more information see Use Incident Inteligence. Add a Workflow Tip The maximum number of workflows you can add is 100 per environment and 50 per account. The workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Notify click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique. Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enriched Data, available to full platform users. Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entitiesData.ids}} For enrichment examples, see Workflow data enrichment examples. Note: The query name needs to be unique because you'll use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important At this stage, visual representation of enrichments are sent to Slack and email. For Servicenow and JIRA destinations, we recommend to limit to NRDB queries with single value results. For example: count, min, or max. The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 5. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notify: Choose one or more destinations and add an optional message. Notifier To save and activate a Workflow, you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, check the documentation on notifications. Click update message once completing the notifier requirements Optionally, test your workflow. We'll use existing data from your account to test what you've configured and send a sample notification Click activate to complete the workflow. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You'll see the names of the variables, which will be replaced with the variable's values at runtime. To use the enrichers' results, use their name.",

For example, to get the state of the EC2 instance use: SELECT latest(ec2State) FROM ComputeSample where provider = 'Ec2Instance' and entityName in {{entitiesData.names}} Copy This query returns a single value (for example, stopped), as the query only uses a single field. The variable entitiesData.names is a list of identifiers for the entities. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. You can use custom variables to enrich your workflow data queries in different ways: Query for when application traffic drops There are times when you want to know when traffic to your application drops. You can use the { { entitiesData.names}} variable in place of your application's name. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName in {{entitiesData.names}} since 10 minutes ago Copy Non-web transactions time Average time the impacted entities spend processing requests/transactions, broken down by process type SELECT average(apm.service.overview.other) * 1000 FROM Metric WHERE appName IN {{entitiesData.names}} FACET `segmentName` TIMESERIES Copy Throughput Number of requests per minute the impacted enitities process SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Non-web throughput' FROM Metric WHERE (appName IN {{entitiesData.names}}) AND (transactionType = 'Other') TIMESERIES Copy Error rate Ratio of errors to the total number of requests processes by the impacted entities SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'Non-web errors' FROM Metric WHERE (appName IN {{entitiesData.names}}) AND (transactionType = 'Other') TIMESERIES Copy Query for transaction failures There are times when you want to know when your application transactions have failed. This query shows the latest HTTP status code responses filtered by the { { entitiesData.names}} variable that violated your alert policy threshold. From Transaction select latest(httpResponseCode), average(duration) where appName in {{entitiesData.names}} Copy Query for Kubernetes consumption overview Use a query like this to get the number of entities and their ingest times within a Kubernetes pod. By identifying what entities have large ingest times, you can begin to address that issue and find a potential remedy.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.

On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

For more information on related features, see our docs on Alerts notification channels, Incident Intelligence destinations, and Proactive Detection notifications. Alerts and Applied Intelligence notification integrations are specific services and platforms you can use to send notifications from New Relic. Integration details Read more about each of our specific notification integrations. Atlassian Jira Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create and update Jira issues. Permissions The required permissions from the Jira API-Token are create, edit, and close tickets. To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira API-Key should have an Admin role. Set up a Jira destination Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced. To create a Jira destination, enter the following information: Destination name: Custom name to identify the destination Jira account endpoint: the URL of the destination User-name: this will be the email address of the user making the connection API token: generated from your Atlassian account Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the test connection button. Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving. Two-way sync You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic-API-KEY) Configure the message template To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Jira message template. Send a test notification You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear. ServiceNow (Incident-Management) Integrate New Relic with ServiceNow Incident-Management and automatically create and update incidents. Roles As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values. For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user and task. A read/write permission to incident To be able to fetch users for the caller column, we required read permissions for the sys_users table. The above permissions can be achieved with the roles personalize_choices, personalize_dictionary, rest_service, itil. Read/Write permissions to the api_key_credentials table is required to enable two-way integration. This can be covered with the roles credentials_admin and discovery_admin. Set up a destination To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information: Destination Name: custom name to identify the destination Domain: the URL of the destination User-name: the name of the user Password: the user name’s password Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the test connection button. Two-way sync You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. Here are some required steps to remember when configuring the two-way integration: Turn on the two-way integration toggle. Open and download this XML file, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML and upload the XML file you downloaded. Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the api_key_credentials. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic Configure the message template Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template. Send a test notification You can see how the ServiceNow incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear. Slack Send notifications-messages to your Slack channels. Prerequisites Your Slack workspace needs to have the New Relic application installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users Set up a Slack destination Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process. On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click Continue. When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions. Clicking `Allow' will redirect you back to the Destination page. Configure the Slack message settings Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process) Send a test notification You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel. Webhook Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like. Set up a webhook destination To create a webhook destination, you need the following: Destination Name: A unique destination name URL: the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed. Authorization mechanism (Optional):. Can be basic authentication or a bearer token Configure the webhook event template Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. The request configuration requires you to: Set a name for the template. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one. Add custom headers (optional). Configure the request’s payload. Customize the webhook payload You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick Variables from the variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook. Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. See Usage examples The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the eventual payload would not form a valid Json, an error will be shown and it won’t be possible to save the template. If the webhook payload conforms a valid Json, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly. Email Send email notifications to users. Configure the email settings Add one or more recipients. Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address. To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, add the full email address. Every recipient will be translated into a 'destination'. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the notifications-log Send a test notification You can send a test notification to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.",

February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals.

Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation.

This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities.

Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Datarobot (formerly Algorithmia) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Datarobot for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations.",

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account, and they cannot be transferred. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to, not just the specific account the key was created under. If the key's user is deleted, all their user keys will be deactivated and will no longer be valid in API requests. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID.

Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial.

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation.

The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's Service Levels? To use New Relic's Service Levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service Levels Management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's Service Levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap. How can I view the queries that define an SLI from the UI? To view the queries that define an SLI, you can click on the ... menu on the SLI summary card, then select the Edit option. The queries will show at the top-right corner. How can I view the queries that define an SLI through the API? To view the queries that define an SLI through the API, use Nerdgraph. In order to view the SLI configuration, you'll need to know the GUID of the entity the SLI is attached to, and replace it in the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { events { badEvents { where from } goodEvents { from where } validEvents { from where } } name } } } } } Copy As a response you are going to receive all the SLIs attached to the entity, the SLI name, and the queries. Keep in mind that either goodEvents or badEvents is going to have content, depending on the configuration of the SLI. Can I chart the SLI attainment on a dashboard? You can chart SLI attainment time series on your custom dashboards using the following query: FROM Metric SELECT clamp_max((count(newrelic.sli.valid) - count(newrelic.sli.bad)) / count(newrelic.sli.valid) * 100, 100) as 'SLI attainment' WHERE sli.id = '<sli.id>' UNTIL 2 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Where sli.id is the SLI identifier. The easiest way to add a chart like this to your dashboard is by using the Add to dashboard option, available on the Details view. Alternatively, you can find the SLI id and SLI attainment query through the Nerdgraph API with the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { name id resultQueries { indicator { nrql } } } } } } } Copy Use the entityGuid of the entity that's associated with the SLI. On the query results, you’ll get the SLI id in the serviceLevel.indicators.id field.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. You can create SLIs and SLOs manually through the New Relic UI. Alternatively, you can automate the process with our NerdGraph API and the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create Service Levels you need a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Key concepts to create SLIs and SLOs Keep in mind these concepts when defining SLIs and SLOs. The SLI entity In the New Relic ecosystem, SLIs and SLOs are linked to entities, which are all the elements in your stack that report data to us, or that generate data that we have access to. The entity that an SLI is related to determines where the SLI/SLO results show. And the entity's tags help filter down SLI results on the Service Levels view. You can define SLIs on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, and therefore you can also base SLIs on custom events. Most custom events are not related to a single New Relic entity, but provide higher level business and user experience insights. In this case, you can still relate the SLI to a specific entity or to a workload. SLI queries SLIs are defined as the percentage of good responses out of the total number of valid requests. Most often you’ll set up your SLIs by defining the valid and good pieces: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs (for example, all transactions related to an endpoint that weren’t initiated by a health check). A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good output for the end-user or client service (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). Alternatively, you can define what you consider to be the bad responses instead: A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad output (for example, the service responded with a server error, causing the client to fail its flow). New Relic will automatically derive the count of good responses as valid - bad. Request-based SLOs are based on an SLI defined as the ratio of the number of good requests to the total number of requests. A request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the compliance period. Suggested SLIs In this section you’ll find some SLIs that are typically used to measure the performance of services and browser applications. SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent Based on Transaction events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error IS TRUE Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration, 95) from Transaction where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and duration < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for APM services instrumented with OpenTelemetry Based on OpenTelemetry spans, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND otel.status_code = 'ERROR' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration.ms, 95) from Span where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND duration.ms < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for browser applications The following SLIs are based on Google’s Browser Core Web Vitals. Browser app largest contentful paint It’s the proportion of valid page views where the largest content element visible in the viewport was rendered faster than the threshold considered to correspond to a good experience. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and largestContentfulPaint<'{largestContentfulPaint}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {largestContentfulPaint} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to render the largest content element visible in the viewport that you consider provides a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 4000 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {largestContentfulPaint} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile (largestContentfulPaint,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Browser app first input delay It’s the proportion of page views where the time between a user's first interacion with the page and the time when the browser responds to that interaction is less than a certain threshold. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and firstInputDelay<{firstInputDelay} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {firstInputDelay} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the browser should respond in to provide a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 300 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {firstInputDelay} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(firstInputDelay,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Browser app cumulative layout shift It’s the proportion of page views with a good cumulative layout shift (CLS). CLS is described as the total sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. If you’d like to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately, add one of these clauses at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and cumulativeLayoutShift < {cumulativeLayoutShift} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {cumulativeLayoutShift} is a pre-set value. To provide a good user experience, your site should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. A CLS score of 0.25 or more is considered a poor user experience. If you’ve decided to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately when you defined the valid events query, add this clause at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' To determine a realistic number to select for {cumulativeLayoutShift} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 75th percentile of page loads for the last 7 or 15 days, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(cumulativeLayoutShift,75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Create and edit Service Levels To create SLIs and SLOs, go to the Service Levels tab at any workload in New Relic One and follow these steps: Select the SLI data source In order to define your new SLI, choose one of these two options: Entity data: Base the SLI on standard data coming from New Relic One agents. This is the most common option. If this is your choice, select the entity (for example, APM service) you want to use. Custom data: Alternatively, you can base the SLI on your custom NRDB events. Use this option when you can't relate the service level data to a specific entity, or when you want to relate the service level directly to a workload. Configure the queries The account where the data is gathered from matches the account of the entity that the SLI refers to. The rest of the fields correspond to the NRDB event that goes into the FROM clause, as well as the WHERE clauses that determine what is a valid and a good/bad event. Please see the section above to know what goes into each field. On the left you’ll see the final queries; and at the bottom you’ll get a preview of the count of valid and good/bad events in the last month. Important SLI queries support NRDB events, but not dimensional metrics yet. Set the SLO time window and target In this step you’ll get a preview of the SLI value. You can add one or more SLOs for this SLI. Just select the length of the time window and the percentage target. The chart on the left will help you anticipate whether the target you’re setting is feasible or if it's often missed. Rolling time-window SLOs are supported. With a rolling time-window, the SLO compliance takes into account the last N days. Every minute, the oldest data drops out of the current calculation and new data replaces it. Define your SLI Select a short name for your SLI that helps you recognize what it’s measuring. Optionally, you may add a description. Edit SLIs After you’ve created an SLI, access the UI and click on the ... menu to edit it:",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service Levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service Level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service Levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find Service Levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the Service Levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example, passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create

config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey:

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Our Incident Intelligence uses logic to correlate your incidents. We call these logic \"decisions.\" We have built-in decisions and you can create and customize your own on the Incident Intelligence Decisions UI page. The more optimally you configure decisions, the better we will group and correlate your incident events, resulting in reduced noise and increased context for on-call teams. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Our UI shows how each decision correlates incidents. Key concepts Here are some key concepts for understanding our decisions logic: What is \"correlation\" and how does it work? For the incident events being sent into Incident Intelligence from your various alerting engines, the most recently created and active incidents are available for correlation. Correlation occurs between two events whenever the criteria in any decision is met. All the events available for correlation are tested against each other in all possible pair combinations and a \"greedy merge\" is performed. This means that if incident A correlates with B into an issue and incident B correlates with incident C into another issue, then AB and BC will also merge together resulting in a single issue including A, B, and C. What types of logic can be used in a decision? At a high level, decisions allow you to define logic based on time (duration between events), frequency (number of events), context (metadata structure & values), and topology (entity relationships). Review your active decisions Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence correlates incidents together. By default, a broad set of global decisions is enabled when you start using Incident Intelligence. To review existing decisions: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions. Review the list of active decisions. To see the rule logic that creates correlations between your issues, click the decision. To see examples of incidents the decision correlated, click the Recent correlations tab. Use any of the other options to enable or disable these global decisions. Your decisions will routinely be analyzed for their efficacy as well as other best practices, and recommendations will be attached for review. Correlation statistics Whether you want to use the suggested decisions we provide using our pattern recognition algorithms, or you want to add in your own correlation logic, you'll get insights into your correlation rate, noise reduction improvement, and the number of correlated issues arising, as shown below. From the UI, you can view the underlying NRQL queries and create your own custom charts and dashboards from this data. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Some example statistics from the decisions UI. Some definitions of statistics: Correlation rate: The percentage of the time correlations are occurring versus not. Total correlated issues: Number of issues correlated with another issue. Noise reduction: Total number of issues after correlation divided by the total number of issues before correlation. Correlation reason: Shows which decisions are correlating issues the most. Use suggested decisions Information about the types of suggested decisions: Suggested decisions: The data from your selected sources is continuously inspected for patterns to help reduce noise. Once patterns have been observed in your data, decisions are suggested that would allow these events to correlate in the future. Accelerated suggested decisions: If you have been using New Relic Alerts for a while, when you add alert policies to sources, we're able to use that historical data to accelerate the pattern recognition step and suggest decisions up to 30% faster. To get started, click on a suggested decision, located under the statistics block on the Decisions UI page. You'll see information on the logic behind the suggested decision, why we think it will help you, and the estimated correlation rate for that decision. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Suggested decision block If there isn't enough data to see the correlation rate, a link right below the percentage estimate will guide you to other sources you can add to get stronger results. Note: if you have less than 5000 incidents per month, you probably won't have suggested decisions. To add the suggested decision, click Activate decision and it will appear enabled, alongside the other decisions. If the decision isn't relevant to your needs, click Dismiss. Create custom decisions You can reduce noise and improve correlation by building your own custom decisions. To start building a decision, go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions, then click Add a decision. Tips on how to use that UI are in the table below. When building a decision, steps 1, 2 and 3 are optional on their own but at least one must be defined in order to create a decision. Option Description Step 1: Filter your data In this step you'll define your filters. Remember correlation occurs between two incidents. If no filters are defined all incoming Incidents will be considered by the decision. Define your filters for the first segment (or bucket) of incidents, and the second segment of Incidents. Types of filter operators range from substring matching to regex matching to help you target the incident events you want and exclude those you don't. All combination of event pairs between segment one and segment two are used in the next steps of the decision. Step 2: Contextual correlation Once you've filtered your data, define the logic used when comparing the incidents' context. You can correlate events based on the following methods: Attribute value comparisons with standard operators Attribute value similarity using similarity algorithms Attribute value regex with capture groups Entire incident comparisons using similarity or clustering algorithms Step 3: Topology correlation Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Contact your account representative to enable this feature. Once enabled, you'll first need to ingest your topology data via our NerdGraph aiTopologyCollector (search for aiTopology in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer). This allows any topology-related decision to be matched with your topology data. Learn more about setting up topology correlation. Give it a name After you configure your decision logic, give it a recognizable name and description. This is used in notifications and other areas of the UI to indicate which decision caused a pair of incidents to be correlated together. Advanced settings Optional. The advanced settings area allows you to further customize how your decision behaves when correlating events. Each setting has a default value so customization is optional. Time window: Sets the maximum time between two incidents created time for them to be eligible for correlation. Issue priority: Overrides the default priority setting (inherit priority) to add higher or lower priority if the Incidents are correlated. Frequency: Modifies the minimum number of incidents that need to meet the rule logic for the decision to trigger. Similarity: If you're using similar to operators in your rule logic, you can choose from a list of algorithms and set its sensitivity. This will apply to all similar to operators in your decision. Similarity algorithms Here are technical details on the similarity algorithms we use: Levenshtein distance This measure is useful for comparing short strings with static schema and fixed length, like host names. Levenshtein distance is also known as edit distance. Details Description How it works The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits to get from one string to the other. Allowed edit operations are deletion, insertion, and substitution. The default similarity threshold for Applied Intelligence decisions is an edit distance of 3. You can change this in the Advanced mode of the decision builder. When to use it This measure is most useful for comparing relatively short strings with static schema and fixed length. Common applications include spell checkers, computational biology, and speech recognition. Examples number/bumble: 3 (number → bumber → bumblr → bumble) trying/lying: 2 (trying → rying → lying) strong/through: 4 (strong → htrong → throng → throug → through) Potential drawbacks Levenshtein distance is not normalized by default to take into account string lengths. Fuzzy score This metric is useful for comparing same-length strings where the same prefix would be a good indicator of correlation. Details Description How it works The fuzzy score algorithm works by allocating \"points\" for character matches between strings: One point for each matching character Two bonus points for subsequent matches The higher the fuzzy score, the greater the similarity between two strings. When to use it Fuzzy score is most useful for strings that have the same, and relatively short (ideally < 5 character), prefixes. A minimum guaranteed score would be (length(expected prefix) * 3) - 2. Examples Example: Decisions / dcsions d: 1 c: 1 i 1 s: 2 o: 1 n: 1 si: 2 io: 2 on: 2 ns: 2 = 15 points Potential drawbacks If the first character of the first string can't be found in the second string, no points are awarded. Fuzzy wuzzy ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of similar length. Details Description How it works The fuzzy wuzzy family of similarity measures was developed by SeatGeek to help find tickets for the same event that have different labels across multiple platforms. The fuzzy wuzzy ratio for two strings is expressed as a percentage, where a higher number indicates a more similar string. It's based on the SequenceMatcher algorithm in Python's difflib. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy ratio is effective for very short (eg. hostname) or very long (eg. event description) strings, especially in comparing strings of similar length. Potential drawbacks This algorithm is too sensitive to be used effectively for 3-10 word strings. One of the other modifications to fuzzy wuzzy (see below) may be a better choice. Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of different length. This modification to the fuzzy wuzzy algorithm helps address the effective length limitation. Details Description How it works With fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio, the shorter string is compared to each substring of the same length within the longer string. The score of the “best matching” substring is used to determine the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio is especially effective for the types of comparisons the basic fuzzy wuzzy algorithm fails at: 3-10 word strings where some significant substrings are likely to be overlapping. Examples For example, between the following strings: DevOps and SRE teams DevOps …”DevOps” (the shorter string, length = 6) would be compared to each substring with length 6 within “DevOps and SRE teams.” Since one of those substrings (“DevOps”) is a perfect match, the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio for these two strings will be high. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy partial match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings where the information may not be in the same order, and of possible different lengths. It works best for sentences such as messages, descriptions, etc. Details Description How it works The token set ratio algorithm follows a few steps to compare strings: Tokenize each string (eg. “DevOps and SRE teams” → “DevOps” “and” “SRE” “teams”; “SRE team and DevOps engineers” → “SRE” “teams” “and” “DevOps” “engineers”) Combine intersecting tokens into a new string, leaving the remaining tokens. (eg. intersecting: ”DevOps”, “and”, “SRE”; remainder1: “teams”; remainder2: “team”, “engineers”) Alphabetize each token group (eg. “and, DevOps, SRE”, “teams”, engineers, team”) Compare the following pairs of strings: Intersection group Intersection group + remainder1 Intersection group + remainder2 The comparison from these pairs (“best matches”) is the fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio. When to use it This metric is helpful in cases where similar strings may have overlapping words but different construction - for example, event descriptions for different issues with the same resource. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy token set match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Jaro-winkler distance This metric is useful for short strings where identical prefixes are a strong indication of correlation. Details Description How it works This metric uses a scale of 0-1 to indicate the similarity between two strings, where 0 is no similarity (0 matching characters between strings) and 1 is an exact match. Jaro-Winkler similarity takes into account: matching: two characters that are the same and in similar positions in the strings. transpositions: matching characters that are in different sequence order in the strings. prefix scale: the Jaro-Winkler distance is adjusted favorably if strings match from the beginning (a prefix is up to 4 characters). When to use it This metric is fairly tolerant of transpositions, but transpositions further apart in the string are less useful. A generally-safe number to use for Jaro-Winkler similarity in moderate to long strings is 0.9; you could use ~ 0.85 in cases where more leniency is okay (if you have other, more specific logic in the decision). Cosine distance This measure is most commonly used to compare large blocks of text (for example, incident descriptions) and provides an easy visualization of similarity. Details Description How it works For each text block you're comparing, a vector is calculated to represent the count of each unique word in the block. The cosine distance of the resulting vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes. When to use it This measure is most useful to compare long blocks of text, specifically when the comparison is meant to consider the text as a whole, and not differences or misspellings in individual words. Examples It is not length of life, but depth of life. Depth of life does not depend on length. Copy Here are the word counts for these sentences: it 1 0 is 0 1 not 1 1 length 1 1 of 2 1 life 2 1 but 1 0 depth 1 1 does 0 1 depend 0 1 on 0 1 And here are those counts represented as a vector: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] Copy The cosine distance of these vectors is about 0.9 (1 is the highest similarity). Potential drawbacks Cosine distance is less useful for situations where small character differences in words are insignificant. Also, cosine distance ignores word order in the text blocks. For more information on cosine distance implementation, see this detailed walkthrough. Hamming distance This measure is useful for shorter text with static schema, but it works only for same-length strings. Details Description When to use it Hamming distance requires the compared strings to be of equal length. This is a useful similarity metric for situations where the difference between two strings may be due to typos, or where you want to compare two attributes with known lengths. For example: Low Disk Space in application myapp in datacenter us01 If you wanted to be tolerant to datacenter changes, the hamming distance should be set to 4. An average use case for Hamming distance would be around 2-3. Examples A simpler version of \"edit distance\" metrics like Levenshtein distance, the Hamming distance between two strings is the number of characters in the string that don't match (in the same position). For example, in the strings below, the Hamming distance is 2: flowers / florets Copy Potential drawbacks In the example above, if the application name changes instead of the datacenter, a correlation would also be created. As the distance grows, the usefulness of Hamming Distance plummets. For this reason, for anything remotely more complicated than being tolerant to 1-2 character substitutions (or if the string lengths will not match), a different similarity measurement should be used. Jaccard distance This measure is useful for comparing large blocks of text, like descriptions or entire incidents. Details Description How it works The distance, denoted as a percentage (0 being completely similar; 1 being totally dissimilar) is calculated with the following formula: 1 - [(# of characters in both sets) / (# of characters in either set) * 100] Copy In other words, the Jaccard distance is the number of shared characters divided by the total number of characters (shared and un-shared). A Jaccard distance of 0.1 means that 10% or fewer characters between two incidents are different. When to use it Jaccard distance is very easy to interpret and especially useful in cases with large data sets. For example, in comparing the similarity between two entire incidents (as opposed to one attribute). Potential drawbacks It's less effective for small data sets or situations with missing data. Also, different permutations of the character set don't affect Jaccard distance, so care should be taken to prevent false positives. Regex operators When building a decision, available operators include: contains (regex): used in Step 1: Filter your data. regular expression match: used in Step 2: Contextual correlation. The decision builder follows the standards outlined in these documents for regular expressions. Regex in Step 1 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute value (the data you’re evaluating) must be matched by the regular expression provided. Captured groups can be used but are not explicitly evaluated. For instance, if the attribute value is foobarbaz, these examples would meet the criteria and test as true: foo.* ^.*baz \\w+ Regex in Step 2 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute values for incident 1 and incident 2 must be included in the match. Also, each captured group (expressions in ( ) parentheses) must exist in both values (incident 1 and incident 2 attributes), and have the same value: The number of captured groups must be equal for both incident attributes. Each group must be equal to the corresponding group between attribute values: the value of the first captured group in the incident 1 attribute value is equal to the value of the first captured group in the incident 2 attribute. For instance, if attribute value 1 is abc-123-xyz and attribute value 2 is abc-777-xyz, then (\\w+)-(?:\\w+)-(\\w+) would meet the criteria: The whole value is matched by the expression. The first and third captured groups have the same respective values. The second group is not captured using ?:, which allows the whole value to match but isn’t used in the capture group comparison. About flags No flags are enabled by default. Some useful flags to include in regular expressions in the decision builder are: CASE_INSENSITIVE: (?i) MULTILINE: (?m) DOTALL: (?s) See field detail for more notes on the function and implementation of each of these flags. Correlation assistant You can use the correlation assistant to more quickly analyze incidents, create decision logic, and test the logic with a simulation. To use the correlation assistant: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Overview, then click the Incidents tab. Check the boxes of incidents you'd like to correlate. Then, at the bottom of the incident list, click Correlate incidents. For best results for correlating incidents, select common attributes with a low frequency percentage. Learn more about using frequency. Click Simulate to see the likely effect of your new decision on the last week of your data. Click on examples of correlation pairs and determine of those correlations are desired. If you like what's been simulated, click Next, and then name and describe your decision. If the simulation result shows too many potential incidents, you may want to choose a different set of attributes and incidents for your decision and run another simulation. Learn more about simulation. Attribute analysis Here are explanations of the two types of attribute analysis displayed in the UI: Common attributes: This analysis simply highlights attributes and values that are the exact same between all selected incidents. Similar attributes: Similarity analysis uses the Levenshtein algorithm with a distance of 3 to find attributes whose values would be the same if 3 or less character changes are performed. Other details: Numerical values as well as single character values are filtered out of the results. Requires two incidents to be selected. Similarity analysis is not performed when 3 or more incidents are selected. To create the best decisions, we recommend choosing common attributes that have a lower frequency in your incidents. Here are tips for understanding how choosing low or high frequency attributes affects your decisions: Low frequency: As an example, an attribute with a 0% in the frequency column is likely a unique identifier or an attribute that only recently reported in your data in the last month. Choosing low frequency attributes may correlate few events. High frequency: On the other end, an attribute with 100% frequency would be one that is present on all your data. Choosing these attributes would correlate all of your events together. By default, the attributes are sorted by frequency with the least frequently reported attributes at the top. Click an attribute's frequency percentage to get more information about the distribution of values we've seen reported for that attribute in the last month. Tips on using simulation Using a set of incidents, the correlation assistant identifies common attributes among those incidents as well as attributes with similar values. Select attributes you believe are good indicators that events should correlate and then simulate the decision. Simulation will test the logic against the last week of your data and show you how many correlations would have happened, in addition to actual examples to inspect. If the simulation looks good, continue creating your real decision. If the simulation doesn't show examples of useful correlations, choose a different set of attributes, and run the simulation again. Here’s a breakdown of the decision preview information displayed when you create a simulation: Potential correlation rate: The percentage of tested incidents this decision would have affected. Total created incidents: The number of incidents tested by this decision. Total estimated correlated incidents: The estimated number of incidents this decision would have correlated. Incident examples: A list of incident pairs this decision would have correlated. You can click on these to see a side by side comparison of all attributes and values to help you determine if the correlation is desired or not. Run the simulation with different attributes as many times as you need until you see results you like. When you’re ready, follow the UI prompts to save your decision. Topology correlation What do we mean by “topology”? For New Relic's Applied Intelligence, topology is a representation of your service map: how the services and resources in your infrastructure relate to one another. When you create a custom decision, you can use our topology correlation, which finds relationships between incident sources to determine if incidents should correlate. Topology correlation is designed to improve the quality of your correlations and the speed at which they're found. Requirements Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Requirements: Given access to topology feature by a New Relic representative Limit of 10K vertices per New Relic organization per environment How does topology correlation work? In this service map, the hosts and apps are the vertices, and the lines showing their relationships are the edges. Topology correlation relies on two main concepts: Vertex: A vertex represents a monitored entity: it's the source from which your incident events are coming from, or describing a problematic symptom about. A vertex has attributes (key/value pairs) configured for it, like entity GUIDs or other IDs, which allow it be associated with incoming incident events. Edges: An edge is a connection between two vertices. Edges describe the relationship between vertices. To set up your topology, you'll use our NerdGraph API. But first, it may help to understand how topology is used to correlate incidents: First, New Relic gathers all relevant incidents. This includes incidents where decision-logic steps 1 and 2 are true, and that are also within the defined time window in advanced settings. In this example, all of the incidents in the dotted-line selection have met these requirements: they've gone through the decision logic in steps 1 and 2, and all contextual comparisons made in decision logic step 2 are true. Next, we attempt to associate each incident to a vertex in your topology graph using a vertex's defining attributes and the available attributes on the incident. Here's an example of the steps for associating incidents with the information in the topology graph. Next, the pairs of vertices which were associated with incidents are tested using the \"topologically dependent\" operator to determine if these vertices are connected to each other. This operator checks to see if there is any path in the graph that connect the two vertices within 5 hops. The incidents are then correlated and the issues are merged together. Add attributes to incident events Incidents are connected to vertices using a vertex's defining attributes (in the example topology under Topology explained, each vertex has a defining attribute \"CID\" with a unique value). Next, Applied Intelligence finds a vertex that matches the attribute. If the defining attribute you'd like to use on your vertices isn't already on your incident events there are a few ways to add it: Tag your entities in New Relic: By tagging your entities, those tags will enrich the incident events generated by Alerts. For example, if you've tagged your entities with CID and their corresponding unique values then you can have defining attributes on your vertex as follows: 'newrelic/tags/CID' : CID_VALUE Facet your data: Creating NRQL alert conditions with one or more facets defined will group your data by attribute. Also, incident events emitted will be enriched with those attributes and values. For incidents, faceted attributes follow the same format: newrelic/tags/ATTRIBUTE_NAME Create or view topology To set up your topology or view existing topology, see the NerdGraph topology tutorial.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept: we define an entity as anything we monitor. This includes (but is not limited to): Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it's important to keep in mind that: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements To use entities, you need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. Besides domainType, other common entity attributes are: id accountId name domainId alertSeverity reporting You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use tags for filtering too. Caution You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entity’s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. Use the freeform query argument to build your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to the examples below, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and benefiting from its inline documentation. Search with queryBuilder The queryBuilder argument is useful to construct simple queries. It allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the query argument instead. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Search with freeform query This is useful to craft more complex queries. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')\"} Copy Fetch entities by GUID When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the entity attribute: { actor { entity(guid: \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\") { name entityType } } } Copy This can also be written as a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the entities attribute: { actor { entities(guids: [\"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3\", \"MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3\"]) { name entityType } } } Copy Otherwise, use a search query: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')\") { query results { entities { name entityType } } } } } Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (and don't have any other effect). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it's supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, use NerdGraph to help you build one. Next, retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and using its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Use tags to filter entity results This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the INFRA domain and belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present. The following query filters entities of the domainType BROWSER-APPLICATION and have the tag clusterAgentId defined. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null\") { results { entities { name } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType APM-APPLICATION domain that belong to awsRegion us-east-1, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'\") { facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: \"language\"}}) { counts { count facet } } } } } Copy For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request, and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Important Currently, you can only remove the following entity types using the Nerdgraph API: APM-APPLICATION, EXT-SERVICE, and REF-REPOSITORY. You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

When acquiring data, the values returned may be affected by the time period you specify and the way the data is stored. For more information, see Extracting metric data. Metric names and values for Apdex To specify Apdex metric names and values with REST API calls, use these codes as needed. Metric name Metric value Apdex score: Application's Apdex score s: Application's satisfied count t: Application's tolerating count f: Application's frustrated count count: Application's request count EndUserApdex score: Browser's Apdex score s: Browser's satisfied count t: Browser's tolerating count f: Browser's frustrated count count: Browser's request count The calculation used to determine the score is explained in Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. The following sections describe how to obtain the score and the s, t, and f values used to arrive at it. Average Apdex score To obtain the average Apdex score (both app and browser) for a specific time period, use this command. This example shows 24 hours in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&values[]=score&from=2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy This will return the same Apdex scores shown in your APM Overview page. APM > (selected app) > Monitoring > Overview: You can use API v2 to return the same Apdex scores shown in the APM Overview page. Average Apdex metric values To obtain the average Apdex metric values for a specific time range, use this command.

All average Apdex values To obtain the complete set of average scores, s, t, f, count, and threshold values for a specific time range, use this command. This example shows 24 hours (adjusted to the time zone 6 hours west of UTC by using %2B06:00) in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00%2B06:00&to=2014-06-10T00:00:00%2B06:00&summarize=true' Copy Tip Even though this example adjusts the time zone, the output still returns as UTC time.",

When acquiring data, the values returned may be affected by the time period you specify and the way the data is stored. For more information, see Extracting metric data. Metric names and values for Apdex To specify Apdex metric names and values with REST API calls, use these codes as needed. Metric name Metric value Apdex score: Application's Apdex score s: Application's satisfied count t: Application's tolerating count f: Application's frustrated count count: Application's request count EndUserApdex score: Browser's Apdex score s: Browser's satisfied count t: Browser's tolerating count f: Browser's frustrated count count: Browser's request count The calculation used to determine the score is explained in Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. The following sections describe how to obtain the score and the s, t, and f values used to arrive at it. Average Apdex score To obtain the average Apdex score (both app and browser) for a specific time period, use this command. This example shows 24 hours in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&values[]=score&from=2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy This will return the same Apdex scores shown in your APM Overview page. APM > (selected app) > Monitoring > Overview: You can use API v2 to return the same Apdex scores shown in the APM Overview page. Average Apdex metric values To obtain the average Apdex metric values for a specific time range, use this command. This example shows 12 hours in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&values[]=score&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T12:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Tip: To return a series of Apdex scores instead of an average, omit &summarize=true. All average Apdex values To obtain the complete set of average scores, s, t, f, count, and threshold values for a specific time range, use this command. This example shows 24 hours (adjusted to the time zone 6 hours west of UTC by using %2B06:00) in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00%2B06:00&to=2014-06-10T00:00:00%2B06:00&summarize=true' Copy Tip Even though this example adjusts the time zone, the output still returns as UTC time.",

By default, this will provide a list of values every minute for the last 30 minutes in JSON format. When acquiring data, the values returned may be affected by the time period you specify and the way the data is stored. For more information, see Extracting metric data. Metric names and values for Apdex To specify Apdex metric names and values with REST API calls, use these codes as needed. Metric name Metric value Apdex score: Application's Apdex score s: Application's satisfied count t: Application's tolerating count f: Application's frustrated count count: Application's request count EndUserApdex score: Browser's Apdex score s: Browser's satisfied count t: Browser's tolerating count f: Browser's frustrated count count: Browser's request count The calculation used to determine the score is explained in Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. The following sections describe how to obtain the score and the s, t, and f values used to arrive at it. Average Apdex score To obtain the average Apdex score (both app and browser) for a specific time period, use this command. This example shows 24 hours in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&values[]=score&from=2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy This will return the same Apdex scores shown in your APM Overview page. APM > (selected app) > Monitoring > Overview: You can use API v2 to return the same Apdex scores shown in the APM Overview page. Average Apdex metric values To obtain the average Apdex metric values for a specific time range, use this command. This example shows 12 hours in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&values[]=score&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00&to=2014-06-09T12:00:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Tip: To return a series of Apdex scores instead of an average, omit &summarize=true. All average Apdex values To obtain the complete set of average scores, s, t, f, count, and threshold values for a specific time range, use this command. This example shows 24 hours (adjusted to the time zone 6 hours west of UTC by using %2B06:00) in XML format for your application ID and its corresponding API key. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Apdex&names[]=EndUser/Apdex&from=2014-06-09T00:00:00%2B06:00&to=2014-06-10T00:00:00%2B06:00&summarize=true' Copy Tip Even though this example adjusts the time zone, the output still returns as UTC time.",

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2).

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds.

DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds.

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. The request queuing time is not included in the calculation of averages. New Relic includes it in this chart as a convenience.",

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. The request queuing time is not included in the calculation of averages. New Relic includes it in this chart as a convenience.",

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following docs for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2).

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following docs for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following docs for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order. Synthetics API attribute Definition apiVersion String: The version number. emails Array of strings: Email addresses for alert notifications with New Relic. frequency Integer: Number of minutes between checks. Valid values include 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, and 1440. id The UUID for the specific Synthetics monitor. locations Array of strings: Array of locations by full label. name String: The monitor's name. scriptLocations String: The name and hmac values for private locations using Verified Script Execution. scriptText String: The BASE64 encoded text for scripted monitors. slaThreshold Double: Value for the Synthetics SLA report, in seconds. status String: Valid values include ENABLED, MUTED, and DISABLED. type String: Type of monitor. Valid values include: SIMPLE (Ping) BROWSER SCRIPT_BROWSER SCRIPT_API uri String: The URI for SIMPLE and BROWSER monitor types; for example, http://my-site.com. Optional for SCRIPT_BROWSER and SCRIPT_API. userID Integer: The specific user ID. Specific monitor endpoint When making REST API calls for a specific monitor, include the monitor_uuid as part of the endpoint. The monitor_uuid is the GUID which is part of the URL. For example, a selected Synthetics monitor has this URL: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/nnnn/monitors/ab123-c456d-e78-90123-f45g Copy The monitor_uuid is the value that follows /monitors/.",

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "The C SDK is designed to support the often complex, multi-threaded nature of C/C++ applications. You can gain a new level of visibility to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also collect and analyze data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. The C SDK can be used to instrument a wide range of applications beyond C or C++. If your application does not use other languages supported by New Relic and can import C libraries, then you can use the New Relic C SDK to take advantage of our monitoring capabilities and features. Monitor app performance one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app): Here is an example of some of the data you can view in New Relic after you deploy the C SDK for your app. If your app meets the C SDK's compatibility and requirements in Linux environments, you can customize the generic library to communicate with New Relic, then start with APM to monitor your app's performance. What you can do How to do it See the big picture Start with the APM Summary page to monitor the throughput, response times, errors, memory and CPU usage transactions in your applications and services, then explore other details with additional APM dashboards. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. When you install the infrastructure agent and APM on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by app in the Infrastructure UI. Identify and fix errors Use error analytics tools to find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. Get alert notifications for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Query user-related data and improve business processes. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create custom queries of your application data. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. And more! Monitor and troubleshoot your application users' desktop experience with your application, including page load timing problems, JavaScript errors, session trace timelines, etc., by using browser monitoring. Use automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints with synthetic monitoring. Analyze and fine-tune your Android and iOS application performance, troubleshoot crashes, compare multiple versions, and examine the performance of HTTP and other network components with mobile monitoring. Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); Copy If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost. Get started with the C SDK To use our C SDK agent: Make sure your application meets the compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. Use our launcher, or follow the installation and instrumentation procedures to install the agent. Within a few minutes, you will be able to view data from your application in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add C data Check the source code The C SDK is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The C SDK is designed to support the often complex, multi-threaded nature of C/C++ applications. You can gain a new level of visibility to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also collect and analyze data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. The C SDK can be used to instrument a wide range of applications beyond C or C++. If your application does not use other languages supported by New Relic and can import C libraries, then you can use the New Relic C SDK to take advantage of our monitoring capabilities and features. Monitor app performance one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app): Here is an example of some of the data you can view in New Relic after you deploy the C SDK for your app. If your app meets the C SDK's compatibility and requirements in Linux environments, you can customize the generic library to communicate with New Relic, then start with APM to monitor your app's performance. What you can do How to do it See the big picture Start with the APM Summary page to monitor the throughput, response times, errors, memory and CPU usage transactions in your applications and services, then explore other details with additional APM dashboards. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. When you install the infrastructure agent and APM on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by app in the Infrastructure UI. Identify and fix errors Use error analytics tools to find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. Get alert notifications for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Query user-related data and improve business processes. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create custom queries of your application data. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. And more! Monitor and troubleshoot your application users' desktop experience with your application, including page load timing problems, JavaScript errors, session trace timelines, etc., by using browser monitoring. Use automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints with synthetic monitoring. Analyze and fine-tune your Android and iOS application performance, troubleshoot crashes, compare multiple versions, and examine the performance of HTTP and other network components with mobile monitoring. Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); Copy If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost. Get started with the C SDK To use our C SDK agent: Make sure your application meets the compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. Use our launcher, or follow the installation and instrumentation procedures to install the agent. Within a few minutes, you will be able to view data from your application in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add C data Check the source code The C SDK is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument.

      "body": "Our C SDK auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic C SDK installation. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Add C data Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors. If you still have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips.",

Install C SDK in container environment Requirements: Meet C SDK requirements C SDK version 1.2 or higher Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon. This only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts. To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the C SDK daemon on a separate docker container: Install the daemon by cloning the C SDK repository and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument. The value for this argument must be HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening.",
