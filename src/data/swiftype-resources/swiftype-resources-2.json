Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance.

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM.

The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

Any requests that hit processRequest will now show a segment in APM's Transaction trace call chart. public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet { // instrumentation via annotation @Trace(dispatcher = true) protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { saveNewRelicInfo(req); doRequestWork(req); writeResponse(resp); } Copy Create custom names for web transactions This part of the API call instructs web transactions containing a storeId value to appear in APM's Transactions page with the custom transaction name you set. A request to any one store will appear under the same, aggregate name. private void saveNewRelicInfo(HttpServletRequest req) { String storeId = req.getParameter(\"storeId\"); if (storeId != null) { // set the name of the Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/store\"); } } Copy Bypass Apdex when collecting non-public data This part of the API call excludes the non-public beta storeID from affecting the Apdex score. if (storeId.equals(\"betaStore\")) { // prevent the method from contributing to the Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex(); } Copy Record the user ID This part of the API call inserts additional metadata into the page load timing request so that browser traces can be tied with the userId. It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java includes a set of API methods for custom instrumentation of asynchronous activity. This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time.

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java includes a set of API methods for custom instrumentation of asynchronous activity. This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning.

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Java. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Java. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Java. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Java. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Java. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release.

For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Additional instrumentation If you use Kamon, take a look at the New Relic Kamon reporter.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations.

Any requests that hit processRequest will now show a segment in APM's Transaction trace call chart. public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet { // instrumentation via annotation @Trace(dispatcher = true) protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { saveNewRelicInfo(req); doRequestWork(req); writeResponse(resp); } Copy Create custom names for web transactions This part of the API call instructs web transactions containing a storeId value to appear in APM's Transactions page with the custom transaction name you set. A request to any one store will appear under the same, aggregate name. private void saveNewRelicInfo(HttpServletRequest req) { String storeId = req.getParameter(\"storeId\"); if (storeId != null) { // set the name of the Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/store\"); } } Copy Bypass Apdex when collecting non-public data This part of the API call excludes the non-public beta storeID from affecting the Apdex score. if (storeId.equals(\"betaStore\")) { // prevent the method from contributing to the Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex(); } Copy Record the user ID This part of the API call inserts additional metadata into the page load timing request so that browser traces can be tied with the userId. It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above as well as specific versions of Java 8 (specifically version 8u262+), we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. See supported Java versions for full details. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

SHA-1 is not supported. Use of other monitoring software If your application uses other application monitoring software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Built-in instrumentation After you install the Java agent, it automatically instruments many popular frameworks and libraries. With automatic instrumentation, the agent collects rich data out of the box, and data will show up in your New Relic dashboards within minutes of installation. Even if your library is not automatically instrumented, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation and the Java agent API. The agent automatically instruments these frameworks and libraries: App/Web servers The agent automatically instruments the following app/web servers.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

Solution After sending a request to your web application, data should appear in the APM UI within two to three minutes. If no data appears after a few minutes: Restart your web server. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify the newrelic.jar file has been installed correctly and that the -javaagent argument has been passed correctly into the JVM: Start your web server if it isn't already running. In your terminal or console, run the appropriate command: Linux or macOS: ps -ef | grep java Copy Windows: wmic process where \"name='java.exe'\" get ProcessID, Commandline /format:list Copy Find the process for the service you're trying to monitor and see if the -javaagent argument is present: If you see a -javaagent argument: The issue is either in agent startup, or the agent is unable to communicate through your firewall to our collector's IP range. If you don't see a -javaagent argument: The argument wasn't passsed to your JVM. Check your startup scripts or other resources to ensure there's nothing preventing it from being passed. For more info about how to pass the argument for your environment, see Include the Java agent with a JVM argument. If niether solution works, keep reading. Verify that your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files are in the same directory. If you have specified a non-default location for the config file using the newrelic.config.file system property, ensure that the config file does exist in that location and is correctly formatted. Generate finest level logs, and check the logs for errors. In the event no log file can be found, see No log file (Java). Check the application server logs for errors related to the New Relic Java agent. You can see the troubleshooting pages Error Bootstrap New Relic Java Agent and Errors Java App Server for examples of observable errors in application server logs that prevent the java agent data from reporting. Verify that your app is reporting to the expected name: In your New Relic log files, search for \"reporting to\", then select the link in the message. For example: {\"message\":\"Reporting to: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/000/applications/000000\"} Copy If you are reporting to multiple application names, look for multiple lines with this message. If the message link does not go to the expected application, ensure that your app name settings are the same in both newrelic.yml and in the web.xml display-name setting.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings Caution Stack traces cannot be obfuscated and may contain sensitive information, including SQL queries. For more information about ignoring errors, see Java agent error configuration. By default, here is how the New Relic Java agent handles the following potentially sensitive data:: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. You cannot implement custom instrumentation using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. You cannot collect user attributes. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Java agent configuration file Custom attributes Java agent API Setting Effects on data security audit_mode boolean Default: false By default, the Java agent does not log all data sent to New Relic in the agent log file. If you set this to true, the agent logs data sent to the New Relic collector in the agent log file. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends by reviewing the agent log file to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true Default for the Custom Instrumentation Editor: false By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic, except for methods instrumented using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. request_uri: Removes the path for the transaction's incoming request. log_sql boolean Default: false By default, you are sending queries to New Relic using record_sql. If you want to log queries in the agent log file as well as send them to New Relic, set this to true. record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages boolean Default: false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. If you are not using high security mode but still want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via recordCustomEvent().

Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings Caution Stack traces cannot be obfuscated and may contain sensitive information, including SQL queries. For more information about ignoring errors, see Java agent error configuration. By default, here is how the New Relic Java agent handles the following potentially sensitive data:: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. You cannot implement custom instrumentation using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. You cannot collect user attributes. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Java agent configuration file Custom attributes Java agent API Setting Effects on data security audit_mode boolean Default: false By default, the Java agent does not log all data sent to New Relic in the agent log file. If you set this to true, the agent logs data sent to the New Relic collector in the agent log file. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends by reviewing the agent log file to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true Default for the Custom Instrumentation Editor: false By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic, except for methods instrumented using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. request_uri: Removes the path for the transaction's incoming request. log_sql boolean Default: false By default, you are sending queries to New Relic using record_sql. If you want to log queries in the agent log file as well as send them to New Relic, set this to true. record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages boolean Default: false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. If you are not using high security mode but still want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via recordCustomEvent(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations.

Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace.

For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations.

Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default true Set to false to disable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default starting in Java agent version 7.1.0 or higher. If you are on agent version 7.0.0, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter(). Find the appropriate methods based on the framework you are using: JSP manual instrumentation Insert the header as close to the top of <head> tag as possible but after the meta tags.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction.

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter().

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ...

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Tip To use Java or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter().

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent.

To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages.

This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version.

Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory.

Solution After sending a request to your web application, data should appear in the APM UI within two to three minutes. If no data appears after a few minutes: Restart your web server. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify the newrelic.jar file has been installed correctly and that the -javaagent argument has been passed correctly into the JVM: Start your web server if it isn't already running. In your terminal or console, run the appropriate command: Linux or macOS: ps -ef | grep java Copy Windows: wmic process where \"name='java.exe'\" get ProcessID, Commandline /format:list Copy Find the process for the service you're trying to monitor and see if the -javaagent argument is present: If you see a -javaagent argument: The issue is either in agent startup, or the agent is unable to communicate through your firewall to our collector's IP range. If you don't see a -javaagent argument: The argument wasn't passsed to your JVM. Check your startup scripts or other resources to ensure there's nothing preventing it from being passed. For more info about how to pass the argument for your environment, see Include the Java agent with a JVM argument. If niether solution works, keep reading. Verify that your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files are in the same directory. If you have specified a non-default location for the config file using the newrelic.config.file system property, ensure that the config file does exist in that location and is correctly formatted.

Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on.

Enable the New Relic add-on After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you complete the requirements and enable the New Relic add-on, configure your Scala Heroku environment for New Relic: Edit your Procfile to point to the agent jar in your app's root folder.

Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com.

In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings. In the Update your New Relic agent section, download the latest agent release for your Java SE release. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the query builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

      "body": "At each step of your cloud adoption process, New Relic plays a critical role in helping you establish baselines, prioritize migration steps, validate improvements, and manage cloud costs. New Relic can also help you refactor, or re-architect, your software and services when you migrate them to the cloud. One key aspect of refactoring your software is splitting out your components into different services available from your cloud provider. For example, you might move your database component away from a traditional MySQL database to a cloud-hosted solution, like Amazon Relational Database (RDS) services such as DynamoDB or Aurora. If you move to the Azure cloud, you might adopt Azure SQL or Cosmos DB. When you move to solutions like those, you increase your database redundancy and resiliency. If you evaluate your overall ROI properly, you should start to see the cost/benefit ratio taking effect once you complete your refactoring. 1. Deploy monitoring New Relic is a true multi-tenant SaaS solution, meaning New Relic designed the agents to work at every layer of your application stack. To get started, deploy the agents: APM to collect application-tier performance metrics Browser monitoring to collect front-end web metrics Mobile monitoring to collect front-end mobile app metrics Infrastructure to collect host/server metrics Cloud-based integrations As you refactor your application and integrate new cloud services, you can also use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. This tutorial describes a database migration and focuses on APM and Infrastructure. 2. Set deployment markers With New Relic, you can track deployments by setting deployment markers. Deployment tracking lets you quickly see how deployments affect your application’s performance and gauge its performance before and after you refactor. You can view deployments on the Deployments page in APM: rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (selected app) > Events > Deployments: Here is an example of the Deployments page and details about a selected deployment. 3. Establish baselines When you install the APM agent at the application layer, New Relic immediately starts collecting and displaying metrics. Use these metrics to set your pre-migration application baseline. APM agents collect performance metrics about outbound calls to databases. In the Monitoring section of the APM UI, click Databases to see a view of your database metrics. The following shows a database running on MySQL that will be refactored to use DynamoDB after migrating to AWS: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Databases: Use this page to view and sort detailed information about database performance. 4. Refactor your applications To take advantage of the cloud, research what services are available from your cloud provider, and then re-architect and uncouple your applications. 5. Create dashboards to track refactoring your applications Apply your KPIs to your baseline measurements to validate cloud improvements, and, ideally, start seeing the impact of moving to the cloud. New Relic’s reporting for database interactions goes much deeper than high-level performance metrics about calls to the database layer in APM. You get access to metrics about slow queries so you can filter by database vendor and cache type. You can also see host and instance details for databases visually within Service Maps and within the context of transaction traces. Because all of your performance metrics are available in New Relic Insights, it is easy to build dashboards to show the performance of your database calls before, during, and after your refactoring in a single unified view. Here is an example of an Insights dashboard for an application that uses DynamoDB and was migrated to AWS: insights.newrelic.com: Build a dashboard that shows the performance of your database calls. 6. Create comparison dashboards To compare both the pre- and post-refactor baselines, create an Insights dashboard that displays the KPIs you baselined. The following dashboard shows the MySQL request query latency as compared with all of the operations for DynamoDB. You can see that, for this example, the request query latency for DynamoDB is too small to even register on the graph. Performance is clearly optimized with this cloud-based database. insights.newrelic.com: Use Insights dashboards to visualize pre- and post-refactor baselines. With APM agents and the integrations New Relic provides, you can measure the effectiveness of refactoring your applications using a broad spectrum of metrics.",

This page helps you understand the sources of data that you’re storing, when they were last updated, and the length the data is stored. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data's source and namespace classifications in New Relic. From the Data retention page, which shows the source of data, you can click Edit settings to adjust the data retention for each source. Important This doc applies to accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. Adjusting retention values You can adjust your retention periods to better support your data needs. You might reduce your contracted retention values to optimize query performance. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types to support more granular analysis over longer periods of time, or to meet data compliance requirements. The ability to edit data retention periods differs depending on your edition of New Relic: Standard edition: your data retention is fixed, and falls between 8 and 395 days (about 13 months) of retention, depending on which capabilities of the New Relic platform you’re using. The prescribed retention levels ensure that you can explore your data and experience the value of New Relic. If you need to raise some of the retention limits for your particular business needs, you can purchase additional retention. Pro or Enterprise: If after you finalize your contracted retention you realize you need to make changes, you can adjust your telemetry data retention settings yourself. Reducing retention values When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear and might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly removing data. That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration. Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce New Relic’s data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges. Retention periods The following table shows the default retention settings for our New Relic One pricing plan. To adjust retention settings, you must be on a Pro or Enterprise tier. Source Event namespace Days retained APM APM 8 APM APM errors 8 Browser Browser 8 Browser Browser events 8 Browser Browser JS errors 8 Browser Browser page view timing 8 Custom events Custom events 30 Serverless Lambda 8 Serverless Lambda custom 8 Serverless Lambda spans 8 Logs Log 30 Infrastructure Infrastructure processes 8 Infrastructure Infrastructure integrations 395 (13 months) Mobile Mobile crash event trails (breadcrumb) 8 Mobile Mobile exception 8 Mobile Mobile general 8 Mobile Mobile error 8 Mobile Mobile crash 90 Mobile Mobile session 90 Synthetics Synthetics data 395 (13 months) Traces Traces 8 Metric data rollup Metric timeslice data is generated by APM (both custom metrics and out-of-the-box metrics), mobile, and browser agents. Metric timeslice data is aggregated first to 1-minute rollups retained for 8 days, then aggregated to 1-hour roll-ups for 90 days, with key metric data in turn being stored indefinitely. We meter on the size of the initial 1-minute rollup, not on any of the subsequent rollups. Read on to learn the key metrics by product. Key metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile Here are the key metrics that are stored indefinitely. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Raw metric data Raw metric data, from APM, Prometheus remote-write API, metrics functionality of the Telemetry SDK, and integrations built on the Telemetry SDK, is handled a little differently. Raw sub-minute metric data is stored for 30 days. Beyond 30 days, 1-minute resolution roll-up events are created and retained for 13 months. As with Metric timeslice data, we meter and bill on the size of the raw ingest, not the subsequent rollups. Metric retention periods are not editable. Account inheritance For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, data retention is inherited by a parent account's child accounts. If a child account has its own data retention settings, those override settings inherited from the parent account. Copy retention values If you have permission to edit retention settings, you can also copy retention values from one child account to other child accounts under the same parent account. To do this, from within a child account, select the Copy settings to other accounts link, and then select the child accounts you want to apply the retention values to. Select the child accounts you want to copy retention values to. Data deletion Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention period ends. If you need to delete data, contact your New Relic account representative. Original pricing plan differences If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you have different data retention rules. See Original data retention.",

      "body": "After you migrate your applications to the cloud and integrate cloud services, use New Relic to measure and validate improvements to your applications. 1. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install New Relic APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install New Relic Infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration. Use dashboards to validate the value of adopting a new cloud service and to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the query builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the query builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET).

Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used.

You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET).

Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value string Required. The string value to add to the current transaction. There is a 255 character limit. Values that exceed this limit will be discarded. AddCustomParameter(string $key, IConvertible $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value IConvertible Required. The numeric value to add to the current transaction. For NRQL functions that require a numeric value (such as min(), max(), or histogram()), you must convert values to singles. Other numeric values will be converted to strings. There is a 255 character limit. Values that exceed this limit will be discarded. Examples Record a numeric value NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"UserGuid\", (Single)1234); Copy Record a string value NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"UserName\", \"Data Nerd\"); Copy Record both numeric and string value To record attributes for a coupon code (string) and an item ID code (single), you could include this code in the parent method: NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"Discount Code\", \"Summer Super Sale\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(\"Item Code\", (Single)31456); Copy",

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value string Required. The string value to add to the current transaction. There is a 255 character limit. Values that exceed this limit will be discarded. AddCustomParameter(string $key, IConvertible $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value IConvertible Required. The numeric value to add to the current transaction. For NRQL functions that require a numeric value (such as min(), max(), or histogram()), you must convert values to singles. Other numeric values will be converted to strings.

AddCustomParameter() is more flexible. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Tip This call only allows you to assign values to pre-existing keys. For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use AddCustomParameter(). Define user-related custom attributes to associate with a browser page view (user name, account name, and product name). The values are automatically associated with pre-existing keys (user, account, and product), then attached to the parent APM transaction. You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser PageView events. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be null). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be null). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the product key. Examples Record three user attributes NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetUserParameters(\"MyUserName\", \"MyAccountName\", \"MyProductName\"); Copy Record two user attributes and one empty attribute NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetUserParameters(\"MyUserName\", \"\", \"MyProductName\"); Copy",

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

Requirements Caution This API has been deprecated. Please use the AddCustomAttribute instead. Compatible with all agent versions. Must be called inside a transaction. Description Attaches a custom attribute (a key/value pair) to the current transaction. For the attribute value, you can report either a string or an IConvertible. (The call name is AddCustomParameter because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters.\") Custom attributes can be used to add more detail and context to errors and transaction traces that are being reported to New Relic. For example, you might add a user name attribute to a transaction to help you filter and analyze your data. You can attach up to 64 attributes per transaction. (Each call to this API method counts as one \"user\" attribute.) You can also attach (or \"forward\") these attributes to browser monitoring's PageView events. For more information, see .NET agent attributes. Important If you want to use your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description AddCustomParameter(string $key, string $value) Copy $key string Required. The key name to add to the transaction attributes. Only the first 255 characters are retained. $value string Required. The string value to add to the current transaction. There is a 255 character limit.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "This document explains how to install New Relic's .NET agent for application performance monitoring on your Azure Web App. (This is not the same as installing the infrastructure monitoring integrations for Microsoft Azure.) Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, the easiest and most reliable option is to use the publicly maintained Azure site extension. Note: Azure Site Extensions are only currently available for Windows App Service Resources. Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows <log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Log file configuration for Linux <log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET agent on Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services platform. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. To make sure you are using the most relevant instructions, first see the .NET agent install overview. Important Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project). Check Web or Worker role's location If Service files are nested within a Solution folder, the NuGet installer cannot locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup, which will in turn prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service. Recommendation: Place the Web or Worker role at the root of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once the New Relic .NET agent is installed, you can move the Cloud role back into the Solution folder. Install the NuGet package for Cloud Services Important The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the new PackageReference format. For more information see Microsoft's package reference documentation For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting File > New > Project. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project). If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project. Open the Package Manager console by selecting Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Set your project as the default project. From the Package Manager command prompt, type Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure and press Enter. Follow the prompts to enter your New Relic license key and your application name as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name. From the Solution Explorer, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select Publish. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials. If applicable, instrument methods for Worker roles. Instrument Worker role A Worker role is a non-web process run as an Azure Cloud Service. To instrument a Worker role, you must create custom transactions. The .NET agent automatically instruments external calls and database calls, but it does not instrument default methods for transactions. Creating custom transactions solves this. After the Worker role starts up and the method executes, transaction data will appear in the APM Summary and Transactions pages under the Non-web category. The NuGet installer automatically adds the NewRelic.AppName parameter to the application config. This appears as <YOUR_WORKER_ROLE_NAME>.dll.config in E:\\approot. The .NET agent also automatically instruments WaWorkerHost.exe. This is the name of the actual Worker role process. Custom instrumentation example for Worker role This is a custom instrumentation example for a Worker role. It creates a custom transaction named ProcessMessage. The transaction begins when the ProcessMessage method is entered, and it ends when the method returns. The following example uses MyWorkerRole as the namespace. If you do not specify a name, it will default to the Solution name. namespace MyWorkerRole { public class NotificationQueue { public bool ProcessMessage(Message message) { // code to process message } } } Copy Here is the custom instrumentation file for the code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-extension\"> <instrumentation> <tracerfactory name=\"NewRelic.Agent.Core.Tracer.Factories.BackgroundThreadTracerFactory\" metricName=\"Custom/ProcessMessage\"> <match assemblyname=\"MyWorkerRole\" classname=\"MyWorkerRole.NotificationQueue\"> <exactmethodmatcher methodName=\"ProcessMessage\" /> </match> </tracerfactory> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy On a local installation, place this instrumentation file in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Extensions. Custom instrumentation file deployment Optional: To send the custom instrumentation file up with an Azure Cloud Service deployment: In your Azure Cloud project, add the instrumentation file to your Worker role inside the Roles folder. After installing the New Relic .NET agent NuGet package, locate newrelic.cmd in your Worker Role project. Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing.

This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures.

Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Tip To use .NET or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, the easiest and most reliable option is to use the publicly maintained Azure site extension. Note: Azure Site Extensions are only currently available for Windows App Service Resources. Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows <log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Log file configuration for Linux <log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker.

Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows <log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Log file configuration for Linux <log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET agent on Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services platform. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. To make sure you are using the most relevant instructions, first see the .NET agent install overview. Important Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project). Check Web or Worker role's location If Service files are nested within a Solution folder, the NuGet installer cannot locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup, which will in turn prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service. Recommendation: Place the Web or Worker role at the root of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once the New Relic .NET agent is installed, you can move the Cloud role back into the Solution folder. Install the NuGet package for Cloud Services Important The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the new PackageReference format. For more information see Microsoft's package reference documentation For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting File > New > Project. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project). If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project. Open the Package Manager console by selecting Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Set your project as the default project. From the Package Manager command prompt, type Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure and press Enter. Follow the prompts to enter your New Relic license key and your application name as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name. From the Solution Explorer, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select Publish. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials. If applicable, instrument methods for Worker roles. Instrument Worker role A Worker role is a non-web process run as an Azure Cloud Service. To instrument a Worker role, you must create custom transactions. The .NET agent automatically instruments external calls and database calls, but it does not instrument default methods for transactions. Creating custom transactions solves this. After the Worker role starts up and the method executes, transaction data will appear in the APM Summary and Transactions pages under the Non-web category. The NuGet installer automatically adds the NewRelic.AppName parameter to the application config. This appears as <YOUR_WORKER_ROLE_NAME>.dll.config in E:\\approot. The .NET agent also automatically instruments WaWorkerHost.exe. This is the name of the actual Worker role process. Custom instrumentation example for Worker role This is a custom instrumentation example for a Worker role. It creates a custom transaction named ProcessMessage. The transaction begins when the ProcessMessage method is entered, and it ends when the method returns. The following example uses MyWorkerRole as the namespace. If you do not specify a name, it will default to the Solution name. namespace MyWorkerRole { public class NotificationQueue { public bool ProcessMessage(Message message) { // code to process message } } } Copy Here is the custom instrumentation file for the code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-extension\"> <instrumentation> <tracerfactory name=\"NewRelic.Agent.Core.Tracer.Factories.BackgroundThreadTracerFactory\" metricName=\"Custom/ProcessMessage\"> <match assemblyname=\"MyWorkerRole\" classname=\"MyWorkerRole.NotificationQueue\"> <exactmethodmatcher methodName=\"ProcessMessage\" /> </match> </tracerfactory> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy On a local installation, place this instrumentation file in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Extensions. Custom instrumentation file deployment Optional: To send the custom instrumentation file up with an Azure Cloud Service deployment: In your Azure Cloud project, add the instrumentation file to your Worker role inside the Roles folder. After installing the New Relic .NET agent NuGet package, locate newrelic.cmd in your Worker Role project. Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app).

Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure Portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure Portal by going to New Relic Accounts > choose your application.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET Framework agent and .NET Core agent on Azure Service Fabric. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures. When using NuGet, you must set some environment variables. This can be done in your application's ServiceManifest.xml file. See the relevant instructions below: .NET Framework In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage Name=\"Code\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> </CodePackage> <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Windows In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Linux In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\"./newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\"./newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy For the .NET Framework only: Edit your app.config file and add the NewRelic.AgentEnabled app setting: <appSettings> ... <add key=\"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"true\" /> ... </appSettings> Copy If your application is generating traffic, data should appear in your APM account in several minutes. If data does not appear, try these troubleshooting steps: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app was published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. See the general troubleshooting documentation to check for common errors.",
