You can adjust the destinations of default attributes and create custom attributes for the attributes collected by New Relic's Go language agent, including: Error traces Transaction events Page views For an extra level of monitoring detail, create custom attributes. Go agent attributes The Go agent receives the following default attributes from your app. You can adjust these default settings and turn attributes on or off for certain destinations. host.displayName The name of the server host under which the current script is executing, called with newrelic.AttributeHostDisplayName. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeHostDisplayName) Copy httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated) Copy Important As of Go agent v3.0.0, this attribute has been marked deprecated and been renamed to http.statusCode. The v3.x agent will continue to produce this attribute, but it will be removed in v4.0.0. request.headers.accept The type as read from the HTTP request's Accept header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestAccept Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestAccept) Copy request.headers.contentLength The incoming request size in bytes as read from the Content-Length request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestContentLength. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestContentLength) Copy request.headers.contentType The incoming request content type as read from the Content-Type request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestContentType. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestContentType) Copy request.headers.host The name from the HTTP host request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestHost. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestHost) Copy request.headers.referer The incoming request referer as read from the Referer request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestReferer.

Therefore the v3.x agents will produce two attributes representing the the contents of the User-Agent HTTP header. To completely exclude the attribute when using the v3.x agent, you must include both the old and new attributes. For example: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgent, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgentDeprecated, ) Copy request.method The HTTP method of the incoming request, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestMethod Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestMethod) Copy response.headers.contentLength The outgoing response size in bytes as read from the Content-Length response header, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseContentLength.

For example: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode, newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated, ) Copy Span and segment attributes If you have Go agent v2.6.0 or higher, you can configure attributes on spans and segments. The Go agent receives the following default attributes from your app. These attributes are only found on span events and transaction trace segments. You can adjust these default settings and turn attributes on or off for certain destinations. db.collection For datastore segments, this is the collection used and represents the table or group, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection) Copy db.instance For datastore segments this is the database name and represents the name of the database where the query is being executed, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBInstance. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBInstance) Copy db.statement For datastore segments this is the parameterized query being executed and represents the query being performed, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBStatement. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBStatement) Copy http.method For external segments this is the http method of the outgoing request, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeHTTPMethod.

Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributePeerHostname) Copy Change attribute destination Use these options to change attribute destinations: Turn destinations on or off To open or close an entire destination to attributes, set the .Enabled flag to true or false. For example, to turn off APM error collection: After the config, add: config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled = false Copy Turn attributes on or off To turn specific attributes on or off, use the .Include or .Exclude methods. For example, to disable AttributeResponseCode: After the config, add: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode) Copy Create custom attributes Add custom attributes by using this method in a transaction: txn.AddAttribute(\"key\", \"value\") Copy The txn variable is the one instrumented for the Go transaction.

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with a New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels = map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation.

Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction.

See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

Any requests that hit processRequest will now show a segment in APM's Transaction trace call chart. public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet { // instrumentation via annotation @Trace(dispatcher = true) protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { saveNewRelicInfo(req); doRequestWork(req); writeResponse(resp); } Copy Create custom names for web transactions This part of the API call instructs web transactions containing a storeId value to appear in APM's Transactions page with the custom transaction name you set. A request to any one store will appear under the same, aggregate name. private void saveNewRelicInfo(HttpServletRequest req) { String storeId = req.getParameter(\"storeId\"); if (storeId != null) { // set the name of the Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/store\"); } } Copy Bypass Apdex when collecting non-public data This part of the API call excludes the non-public beta storeID from affecting the Apdex score. if (storeId.equals(\"betaStore\")) { // prevent the method from contributing to the Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex(); } Copy Record the user ID This part of the API call inserts additional metadata into the page load timing request so that browser traces can be tied with the userId. It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard. Important For metrics you want to graph in custom dashboards, be sure to prepend Custom/ to the metric name; for example, Custom/Promotion. String promotionId = req.getParameter(\"promotionId\"); if (promotionId != null) { // increment the metric counter for the given name NewRelic.incrementCounter(\"Custom/Promotion\"); } Copy Send instructions to the handler This part of the API call sends a set of instructions to the handler for processing requests and handling exceptions. protected void doRequestWork(HttpServletRequest req) { try { long millisToSleep = new Random().nextInt(5000); Thread.sleep(millisToSleep); // record a response time in milliseconds for the given metric name NewRelic.recordResponseTimeMetric(\"Custom/RandomSleep\", millisToSleep); } catch (InterruptedException e) { // report a handled exception NewRelic.noticeError(e, false); } } protected void writeResponse(HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException { Copy Include page load timing code in the HTTP response This part of the API call defines what to include in the HttpServletResponse. For manual instrumentation of browser monitoring to monitor page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM): Set the header after the < head> tag. Set the footer at the end of < body> tag. resp.setContentType(\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\"); PrintWriter out = resp.getWriter(); out.println(\"<html>\"); out.println(\"<head>\"); // get the RUM JavaScript header for the current web transaction out.println(NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()); out.println(\"<title>NewRelic API example servlet</title>\"); out.println(\"</head>\"); out.println(\"<body>\"); out.println(\"<h1>API example</h1>\"); // get the RUM JavaScript footer for the current web transaction out.println(NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter()); out.println(\"</body>\"); out.println(\"</html>\"); out.close(); } Copy Complete the HTTP response This part of the API call defines the remaining information to include in the HttpServletResponse response. protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { processRequest(req, resp); } protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { processRequest(req, resp); } } Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. The agent should instrument supported frameworks automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, in addition to custom code and frameworks or technology not listed in the Compatibility and requirements for the Java agent documentation, some implementations of supported frameworks may require custom instrumentation. This document describes how to use the Java agent API to instrument external calls, messaging frameworks, cross application tracing (CAT), datastores, and web frameworks. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. External API The External API enables applications to report external service calls to New Relic. This information appears on the External services page in APM. To report HTTP external activity, simply create an instance of ExternalParameters using the HttpParameters builder, and call reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters parameters) on the traced method you want to report. External API String library = \"HttpClient\"; // a user-recognizable name for the library that is being used URI uri = request.getURI(); // the URI that is being requested String procedure = \"execute\"; // these are typically named after the method in the library that's being instrumented // construct external parameters ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // report the current method as doing external activity NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy External parameters builders There are several builders to create ExternalParameters: DatastoreParameters HttpParameters GenericParameters MessageConsumeParameters MessageProduceParameters These builders create the input parameter object for TracedMethod's reportAsExternal API call. These parameter objects are used for things like linking HTTP external calls via cross application tracing, tracing external calls to a datastore, tracing external calls to a datastore with additional slow query processing, as well as tracing calls between message producers and consumers. Important All of the methods of this class have the potential to expose sensitive private information. Use caution when creating the arguments, paying particular attention to URIs and string values. Cross application tracing API The cross application tracing (CAT) API allows the New Relic Java agent to link transactions across applications monitored by New Relic. The API uses client and server wrappers that allow the agent to read headers from requests, and add headers to responses. Client wrappers For the agent to write outbound request headers in the client initiating the request, use the OutboundHeaders interface. For example: OutbounderHeaders implementation class OutboundWrapper implements OutboundHeaders { private final HttpUriRequest delegate; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's request object public OutboundWrapper(HttpUriRequest request) { this.delegate = request; } // This allows the agent to add the correct headers to the HTTP request @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { delegate.addHeader(name, value); } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy For the agent to read inbound response headers in the client receiving the response, implement the InboundHeaders. For example: InboundHeaders implementation class InboundWrapper implements InboundHeaders { private final CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders; // OutboundHeaders is implemented by delegating to the library's response object public InboundWrapper(CloseableHttpResponse responseHeaders) { this.responseHeaders = responseHeaders; } // New Relic CAT specifies different header names for HTTP and MESSAGE @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } // this allows the agent to read the correct headers from the HTTP response @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return responseHeaders.getFirstHeader(name).getValue(); } } Copy Server wrappers For the agent to get web request headers, you must extend the ExtendedRequest class: Extend ExtendedRequest class // Extend ExtendedRequest class to create a wrapper for the Request object class RequestWrapper extends ExtendedRequest { private IHTTPSession session; public RequestWrapper(IHTTPSession session) { super(); this.session = session; } @Override public String getRequestURI() { return session.getUri(); } @Override public String getHeader(String name) { return session.getHeaders().get(name); } @Override public String getRemoteUser() { return null; } @SuppressWarnings(\"rawtypes\") @Override public Enumeration getParameterNames() { return Collections.enumeration(session.getParms().keySet()); } @Override public String[] getParameterValues(String name) { return new String[]{session.getParms().get(name)}; } @Override public Object getAttribute(String name) { return null; } @Override public String getCookieValue(String name) { return null; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } @Override public String getMethod() { return session.getMethod().toString(); } } Copy For the agent to set the web response headers, implement the Response interface: Response interface implementation // Implement Response interface to create a wrapper for the outgoing Response object public class ResponseWrapper implements com.newrelic.api.agent.Response { private final Response httpResponse; public ResponseWrapper(Response httpResponse) { this.httpResponse = httpResponse; } @Override public int getStatus() throws Exception { return 200; } @Override public String getStatusMessage() throws Exception { return null; } @Override public void setHeader(String name, String value) { httpResponse.addHeader(name, value); } @Override public String getContentType() { return \"\"; } @Override public HeaderType getHeaderType() { return HeaderType.HTTP; } } Copy CAT implementation using wrappers Using the wrapper objects described in the previous sections, you can enable the Java agent to do cross application tracing (CAT) on the client and server side. For example: Cross application tracing: Client-side @Trace public int makeExternalCall(URI uri) throws IOException { String library = \"HTTPClient\"; String procedure = \"Execute\"; HttpUriRequest request = RequestBuilder.get().setUri(uri).build(); // Wrap the outbound Request object OutboundWrapper outboundHeaders = new OutboundWrapper(request); // Obtain a reference to the method currently being traced TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); // Add headers for outbound external request tracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(outboundHeaders); CloseableHttpClient connection = HttpClientBuilder.create().build(); CloseableHttpResponse response = connection.execute(request); // Wrap the incoming Response object InboundWrapper inboundHeaders = new InboundWrapper(response); // Create an input parameter object for a call to an external HTTP service ExternalParameters params = HttpParameters .library(library) .uri(uri) .procedure(procedure) .inboundHeaders(inboundHeaders) .build(); // Report a call to an external HTTP service tracedMethod.reportAsExternal(params); return response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(); } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the client that is initiating the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement OutboundHeaders and InboundHeaders using framework classes on the client. Use addOutboundRequestHeaders(OutboundHeaders outboundHeaders) to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound request. Create ExternalParameters object using HttpParameters builder and provide inbound response headers. Report as an external request using reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params). Cross application tracing: Server-side @Trace(dispatcher = true) @Override public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) { // Obtain a reference to the current Transaction Transaction tx = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(); // Set the name of the current transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Custom\", \"ExternalHTTPServer\"); // Wrap the Request object ExtendedRequest req = new RequestWrapper(session); // Set the request for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebRequest(req); queryDB(); Response res = newFixedLengthResponse(\"<html><body><h1>SuccessfulResponse</h1>\\n</body></html>\\n\"); // Set the response for the current transaction and convert it into a web transaction tx.setWebResponse(new ResponseWrapper(res)); // Instruct the transaction to write the outbound response headers tx.addOutboundResponseHeaders(); // Mark the time when the response left the server tx.markResponseSent(); return res; } Copy In this sample code, the agent is configured to report an external call using CAT on the server that is responding to the request. These steps can be summarized as follows: Implement Response and extend the ExtendedRequest class using framework classes on the server. Use setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) to convert the transaction into a web transaction and together provide the agent with the inbound request headers and a place to record the outbound headers. It's important to use both setWebRequest(ExtendedRequest request) and setWebResponse(Response response) together, because the transaction name depends on the request object, and the response code depends on the response object. Use addOutboundResponseHeaders() to have the agent add appropriate headers to the outbound response. Mark the end of the response with a call to markResponseSent(). Messaging API The messaging API allows applications to report interactions with message queue brokers. It builds on top of the External API by providing the MessageConsumerParametersMessage and MessageConsumerParameters. This API generates the necessary metrics to identify message broker interactions. The UI will use these metrics to display messaging data including segments in transactions with the appropriate action and count (message put, or message take), a dedicated messages tab in transaction traces, and more. Providing inbound and outbound headers to the API also allows the agent to add CAT headers, and record CAT metrics, which enables the UI to draw service maps that show connections between applications. Important The messaging API relies on two-way communication between producers and consumers. If your producer does not receive an acknowledgment from a consumer, like in a fire-and-forget pattern, the messaging API will not accurately reflect the interactions with message queue brokers. The following example demonstrates how to instrument a fictional JMS library. Messaging API implementation public class MessageProducer { // instrument the method that puts messages on a queue @Trace public void sendMessageToQueue(Message message) { ExternalParameters messageProduceParameters = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .outboundHeaders(new OutboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageProduceParameters); } } Copy To simplify things, the agent assumes that sendMessageToQueue always puts a message in a named queue. In reality, a message can be sent to different destination types, including named queues, temporary queues, topics, and temporary topics. The API provides an enum to report messages to different destination types: NAMED_QUEUE, TEMP_QUEUE, NAMED_TOPIC, TEMP_TOPIC. It's important to specify the appropriate destination type because the UI will display the names of named queues and named topics and will omit the names of temporary queues and temporary topics. If the library is capable of transmitting CAT headers, an OutboundHeaders object will be provided to the API so that the agent can add CAT headers. Message with CAT headers implementation public class MessageConsumer { @Trace public Message messageReceive() { ExternalParameters messageConsumeParameters = MessageConsumeParameters.library(\"JMS\") .destinationType(DestinationType.NAMED_QUEUE) .destinationName(message.getJMSDestination()) .inboundHeaders(new InboundWrapper(message)) .build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(messageConsumeParameters); return message; } } Copy Datastore API When a traced method is reported as an external datastore call, the call is shown in the APM Databases page. Because datastores are external to the running application, the method is reported as datastore activity using the reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method. The only difference is that a different builder, DatastoreParameters, is used to create the appropriate ExternalParameters object. Datastore API implementation TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .build()); Copy Datastore API: Slow query This API call provides the same behavior as the Datastore API call and extends it to allow slow query information to be tracked. The same reportAsExternal(ExternalParameters params) method and builder are used, but with an additional builder method. Datastore with slow query implementation Creating the appropriate ExternalParameters object is illustrated below: //Reporting a method as doing datastore activity TracedMethod tracedMethod = NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod(); tracedMethod.reportAsExternal( DatastoreParameters .product(\"sqlite\") // the datastore vendor .collection(\"test.db\") // the name of the collection (or table for SQL databases) .operation(\"select\") // the operation being performed, e.g. \"SELECT\" or \"UPDATE\" for SQL databases .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) // the datastore instance information - generally can be found as part of the connection .databaseName(\"test.db\") // may be null, indicating no keyspace for the command .slowQuery(rawQuery,QUERY_CONVERTER) .build()); private static QueryConverter<String> QUERY_CONVERTER = new QueryConverter<String>() { @Override public String toRawQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to transform raw query object to string return statement; } @Override public String toObfuscatedQueryString(String statement) { // Do work to remove any sensitive information here return obfuscateQuery(statement); } }; Copy WebFrameworks API The WebFrameworks API allows the agent to report additional identifying information about the application. // Set the dispatcher name and version which is reported to APM. // The dispatcherName is intended to represent the type of server that this // application is running on such as: Tomcat, Jetty, Netty, etc. NewRelic.setServerInfo(String dispatcherName, String version) // Set the app server port which is reported to APM. NewRelic.setAppServerPort(int port) // Set the instance name in the environment. // A single host:port may support multiple JVM instances. // The instance name is intended to help identify a specific JVM instance. NewRelic.setInstanceName(String instanceName) Copy Tip These values can be set only once. Subsequent calls will have no effect. WebFrameworks API implementation public NewRelicApiClient() throws IOException, URISyntaxException { super(8080); // Set Dispatcher name and version. NewRelic.setServerInfo(\"NanoHttp\", \"2.3.1\"); // Set Appserver port for jvm identification NewRelic.setAppServerPort(8080); // Set JVM instance name NewRelic.setInstanceName(\"Client:8080\"); start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false); System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on http://localhost:8080/ \\n\"); } Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic Java agent API Javadoc (detailed API documentation on GitHub) Java agent API example (example application using custom instrumentation for cross application tracing and external datastore calls) Java agent API guide (goal-driven guide to using the Java agent API) Java instrumentation by annotation (how to use annotations to instrument your application code)",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...)

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

      "body": "New Relic for Java includes a set of API methods for custom instrumentation of asynchronous activity. This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning.

Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in unsupported frameworks, but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work. Asynchronous operations With a synchronous programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing. Asynchronous programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases. Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning.

      "body": "New Relic for Java (agent version 3.37 or higher) includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can still be useful to add detail. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. For more information about how New Relic instruments and displays async work in the APM UI, see Monitoring considerations for asynchronous applications. For details on the actual classes and methods, see the Javadoc. For general information on the Java agent API, see the Java agent API guide. For troubleshooting common problems, see Troubleshooting Java asynchronous applications. Async tracking tools: Tokens and segments The Java agent API provides two ways to trace asynchronous activity: Tokens: Tokens are passed between threads to link asynchronous units of work to a specific transaction. They do not perform any timing directly. Segments: Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. Segments are typically used to track external calls that are completed by a callback mechanism. Tokens: Connect async threads Use tokens to link arbitrary units of work that are on separate threads. This section describes how to use the token-related calls together to instrument async work. For detailed information on classes and methods, see the Javadoc. To use tokens, you first need to create the token, then link another call to the originating transaction. You should link the token as soon as possible within the other call. If you do not link the token immediately, you risk losing any methods that contain an @Trace below the call you are trying to link. You can also expire the token in the original call. The Java agent will then link the work in the New Relic UI. These examples illustrate how to use the token-related calls together: 1. Start a transaction, then create and expire a token Consider the method parallelStream() in the code snippet below. Because some of the calls to requestItemAsync() will occur on a separate thread, a token is created and passed to link that asynchronous work back to the requesting thread. /** * Example showing multi-threaded implementation of requesting data using a parallel {@link Stream}. */ @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) // starts a transaction public ResponseEntity<String> parallelStream(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<Long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). getToken() ; List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> requestItemAsync\\(id, token)) // note we're calling a different method than parallelStreamBad .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire() ; return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream\", results); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Tells the agent to start a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. getToken(): Creates the token which will link the work together. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.expire(): Expires the token. This allows the transaction to end. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Mark a transaction as async and link to request thread The following code example shows requestItemAsync, which might execute on a separate thread from the requesting thread. For this reason, the token that was created in the previous code example is linked to the Transaction in requestItemAsync. Note that requestItemAsync() has the @Trace(async=true) annotation, which tells the agent to trace this method if it's linked to an existing transaction. After parallelStream() collects all results, the token is expired. This is important because it makes sure the transaction doesn't stay open after parallelStream() completes. @Trace(async = true) private Item requestItemAsync(long id, Token token) { token.link() ; return requestItem(id); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: @Trace(async = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. token.link(): Links the work being done in requestItemAsync() (which is executing on a different thread) to the requesting thread. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI Here's an example of a transaction trace in the APM UI for this endpoint: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon. All asynchronous method calls linked with a token are indicated with an Async icon in the Drilldown column. It's not necessary to link methods that are on the same thread, but doing so will have no negative effect. It's often the case that a single token can be shared, like in the parallelStream() example. Tip By default, a transaction can create a maximum of 3000 tokens and each token has a default timeout of 180s. You can change the former limit with the token_limit config option and the latter with the token_timeout config option. Traces for transactions that exceed the token_limit will contain a token_clamp attribute. Increasing either config option may increase agent memory usage. Segments: Time arbitrary async activity Segments are used to measure an arbitrary piece of asynchronous application code, not necessarily associated with a method or thread. This is most commonly used to time connections to external services. Use segments if you want to: Time code that completes via a callback Time an asynchronous call that spans many methods Measure the time between when work is created and when it executed (for example, in a thread pool) 1. Create a transaction and call an external service The method below makes a call to an external service (in this case a database) using the method storeItem(): /** * Example showing single threaded implementation of inserting data into a datasource. */ @RequestMapping(\"insert\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) //starts a transaction public ResponseEntity insert(@RequestParam(\"id\") Long id) { if (id != null) { storeItem(id); return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.OK); } else { return new ResponseEntity<>(\"insert\", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } Copy The goal in this case it to find out how long the Callable in the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool before executing, rather than determining how long storeItem() runs. For this reason, a segment is used instead of a token, and @Trace(async = true) is not necessary like it was for a token. The agent API call in this sample is: @Trace(dispatcher = true): Starts a transaction. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 2. Start a segment, report externals, and end the segment The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. 3. View your async trace in the New Relic UI When the method completes, APM displays a transaction trace with one external call: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: A single asynchronous segment is called out in the Drilldown column. Tip By default, the agent can track a maximum of 1000 segments during a given transaction. You can change this limit with the segment_timeout config option. Traces of transactions that exceed this limit will contain a segment_clamp attribute. Increasing this limit may increase agent memory usage.",

Async and thread-switching For applications that use asynchronous processing, thread-switching is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented. Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and getScoreAsync() returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while getScoreAsync() makes an external call and sends a reply. @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(\"getScores\", method = RequestMethod.Get produces = “text/plain”) public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = \"uids\") uids) { return Arrays.stream(uids.split(\",\")) .parallel() .map(Integer::valueOf) .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid)) .collect(Collectors.toList());} Copy Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks: With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as Async. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the Trace details page: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > Transaction trace > Trace details: When asynchronous activity in a Java application is detected by APM, it is indicated with the Async flag in the Drilldown column. Async and response time Response time is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly. The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: On the APM Summary page, asynchronous activity in a Java app can result in the response time (the blue line) being less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods don't have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Custom instrumentation with the async API To implement custom instrumentation of async work, see the Java agent async API guide.

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file.

Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

SHA-1 is not supported. Use of other monitoring software If your application uses other application monitoring software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Built-in instrumentation After you install the Java agent, it automatically instruments many popular frameworks and libraries. With automatic instrumentation, the agent collects rich data out of the box, and data will show up in your New Relic dashboards within minutes of installation. Even if your library is not automatically instrumented, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation and the Java agent API. The agent automatically instruments these frameworks and libraries: App/Web servers The agent automatically instruments the following app/web servers.

Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent reads its configuration from the newrelic.yml file. By default the agent looks for this file in the directory that contains newrelic.jar. You can override the config file's location by setting the newrelic.config.file system property to a fully qualified file name. Configuration file structure The newrelic.yml file is split into stanzas corresponding to different environments: Test Development Staging Production (default) New Relic applies settings in the common stanza to each of these environments. You can select other environments as the default by setting the newrelic.environment system property to the environment name. Tip A newrelic.yml template is available. If you edit newrelic.yml, be careful to conform to the YAML format. Use a YAML validator to ensure the syntax is accurate before using the file with New Relic's Java agent, and follow these rules: Java agent newrelic.yml Requirements Format YML files are case sensitive. Indentations All indentations must be in increments of two characters. Other indentations will result in an Unable to parse configuration file error upon agent startup. Use the same level of indentation for data in the same stanza of the file. Indent any sub-stanzas by an additional two spaces. Changes to file You must restart your JVM host process for changes to take effect. Exception: Property changes to log_level and audit_mode do not require a restart. Property changes under circuit breaker don't require a restart. Configuration settings precedence To override any setting in the config file, use a system property override. In certain environments, environment variables can also be used to override both the config file and the system properties. The environment variables primarily exist to support Heroku. When used, server-side configuration overrides all other configuration settings. With the Java agent, server-side configuration overrides all other settings. Environment variables override Java system properties. Java properties override user configuration settings in your newrelic.yml file. User settings override the newrelic.yml default settings. Configuring the Java extensions directory The Java agent reads the configuration files on process startup. To identify the directory where the files are located, either create a new or specify an existing extensions directory: Create an extensions directory To create the extensions directory: Navigate to the directory where newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml are located. Create a directory named extensions. In newrelic.yml, check that the property extensions.dir is not set. Specify an existing extensions directory To use an existing Java extensions directory: In your newrelic.yml file, locate the common section. Use the property extensions.dir to specify the location of the file. General configuration settings Set these options in the common stanza. To override any of these options, use a newrelic.config prefixed system property. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Defines the application name used to report data to New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2 use this: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Flag to enable the agent. Use this setting to force the agent to run or not run. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Float Default 1.0 The apdex_t threshold in seconds for the application's Apdex score. For Java agent versions 1.2.008 or higher, the apdex_t value is set in the UI and the value in newrelic.yml is ignored. appserver_port Type Integer Default (none) Number to differentiate JVMs for the same app on the same machine. New Relic uses host/port for uniqueness, so you can distinguish the JVMs by putting a switch like this into the startup arguments for each JVM: -Dnewrelic.config.appserver_port=8081 Copy Once you have used appserver_port to name the JVMs and restart them, you should be able to see them individually in the dropdown and in the profiling interface. Important This is only a change for New Relic; it doesn't actually affect the port on which the host communicates in any way. audit_mode Type Boolean Default false Enables plain text logging of all data sent to New Relic to the agent logfile. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. ca_bundle_path Type String Value Format /path/to/ca/cert/bundle.pem Specifies a path to a custom SSL certificate bundle that will be used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. If your custom SSL certificate bundle doesn't include certificates that are sufficient to connect to New Relic then you'll need to merge the required certs into your custom certificate bundle. use_private_ssl Type Boolean Default false The following SSL certificates are bundled into the agent jar: META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy By default (use_private_ssl: false) the agent will use the SSL certificates bundled into the JDK to establish a secure connection to New Relic or the custom SSL certificates bundle specified by ca_bundle_path. If you want to use the SSL certificates bundled with the agent, set use_private_ssl: true. Note: use_private_ssl will be ignored if ca_bundle_path is set. enable_auto_app_naming Type Boolean Default false Enables the reporting of data separately for each web app. Set to true to enable support for auto app naming. The name of each web app is detected automatically and the agent reports data separately for each one. This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for web apps in New Relic. For more information, see Automatic application naming. For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. enable_auto_transaction_naming Type Boolean Default true Enables component-based transaction naming. Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming. Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction. For more information, see Naming web transactions. Caution Unless you implement API calls to name your transactions, disabling auto-transaction naming is very likely to cause Metric grouping issues. enable_custom_tracing Type Boolean Default true Enables all instrumentation using an @Trace annotation. Disabling this causes @Trace annotations to be ignored. event_ingest_uri Type String Default https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/events Event ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send events to other ingest endpoints (for example, EU production: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/events). extensions.dir Type String Default (none) Defines the location of the optional extensions directory. If this property is not set, the agent will look for a subdirectory named extensions in the same directory as newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml. high_security Type Boolean Default false In order for high security to be enabled, this property must be set to true and the high security property in the New Relic user interface must be enabled. Enabling high security means SSL is turned on, request and message queue parameters are not collected, and queries cannot be sent to New Relic in their raw form. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. insert_api_key Type String Default (none) A valid Insert API Key for your account. This is not currently used by the agent. labels Type String Default \"\" Attach tags to this app. Note that this option now enables tags, which replaced the label feature. You can still query your historical labels. max_stack_trace_lines Type Integer Default 30 Limits the number of lines the agent collects from each stack trace. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. metric_ingest_uri Type String Default https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 Metric ingest URI used by some agent features. Defaults to the US production ingest endpoint. Can be manually configured to send metrics to other ingest endpoints (for example EU production: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1). proxy_host Type String Default (none) The proxy host through which to connect to the New Relic collector. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_password Type String Default (none) The password for proxy authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. Important The Java agent supports Basic (clear text) authentication. proxy_port Type String Default 8080 The proxy host port number. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. proxy_user Type String Default (none) The username for proxy authentication, such as Basic (clear text) authentication. If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other proxy settings are optional. The username and password settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges from a proxy server. proxy_scheme Type String Default (none) The proxy scheme used. Setting proxy_scheme: \"https\" will allow the agent to connect through proxies using the HTTPS scheme. reactor-netty.errors.enabled Type Boolean Default false Whether errors are reported for Reactor Netty. Default is false. If set to true, Reactor Netty errors will be reported. Important Only available in Java agent 6.3.0 and above. Notice, default was changed to false as of Java agent 6.5.0. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default false Enable delayed JVM shutdown to give the agent a chance to send latest metric data to New Relic before JVM shutdown. send_data_on_exit_threshold Type Integer Default 60 The number of seconds after which the agent will use the send_data_on_exit setting. send_environment_info Type Boolean Default true Enable reporting of JVM settings to New Relic. send_jvm_props Type Boolean Default true When set to true, JVM properties will be sent to New Relic. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Requires connections to the New Relic collector to go over SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your application code, so response times will not be directly affected by this change. Important As of Java agent 3.48.0, SSL is enabled by default and the config option to disable it has been deprecated. As of Java agent 4.0.0, the ability to disable SSL has been removed. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Enable the agent to connect the New Relic collector immediately upon app startup. scala_futures_as_segments Important This applies to Java agent version 3.44.0 or higher. Type Boolean Default false For more concise transaction trace details, the agent does not report Scala Futures as transaction segments, and those Futures do not contribute to the transaction’s total time. Enabling scala_futures_as_segments increases your overhead. If you want Scala Futures to report as transaction segments so you can view them in a transaction trace, you can enable it: scala_futures_as_segments: enabled: true Copy Logging configuration These are part of the general configuration variables. They are broken out here because they are frequently tweaked for debugging. Some of the logging configuration variables are dynamic and do not need a host restart for them to take effect. For instance, if log files are growing too quickly, log_level can be set to a less verbose setting to reduce the reporting rate. Here is the order of precedence for configuration variables affecting log rotation. If log_daily is true, other log rotation settings are ignored. If log_file_count is 1 or 0, the size limit is ignored. Finally, the agent applies log_limit_in_kbytes. Depending on the growth rate, it is possible for the log file size to exceed the configured value by a small amount. log_daily Type Boolean Default false Set to true to roll the logs daily. Overrides the other configuration variables that affect log rotation. log_file_count Type Integer Default 1 The maximum number of log files to keep when using log rotation. log_file_name Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. log_file_path Type String Default logs subdirectory where newrelic.jar is located The log file path. Tip If log_file_path is specified, the directory must already exist. If the default value is used, the agent will attempt to create the directory. log_level Type String Default info The log verbosity level. The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging separate from that of your application. Valid options, in order of verboseness, are: off severe warning info fine finer finest This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. log_limit_in_kbytes Type Integer Default 0 The log file size in kilobytes at which log files are rotated. Set to 0 for no limit. JMX To set these options, use the jmx stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.jmx prefixed system property. The Java agent uses JMX to collect JVM data. Additionally the agent can expose linking metadata over JMX that can be used by other tracing systems. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all JMX functionality. linkingMetadataMBean Type Boolean Default false This setting can be enabled to allow the Java agent to expose linking metadata over remote JMX. Important This applies to Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher. JFR (Real-time profiling) The Java agent uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to collect high fidelity JVM data for Real-time profiling. Real-time profiling can be configured in the jfr stanza in the agent yaml, with system properties prefixed by newrelic.config.jfr., or with environment variables prefixed with NEW_RELIC_JFR_. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable Real-time profiling with JFR. Important Real-time profiling with JFR is on by default in Java agent version 7.1.0. If you are on any other agent version 7.0.0 or higher, you can turn on JFR by changing the value to true. audit_logging Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable audit logging which will display all JFR metrics and events in each harvest batch. Audit logging is extremely verbose and should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Important This applies to Java agent version 7.0.0 or higher. Attributes To set these options, use the attributes stanza. To override them, use a newrelic.config.attributes prefixed system property. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. There is also an attribute stanza under each destination. For more information, see Java agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes and Attribute examples. enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. Important For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is set to false by default. include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic. Separate the keys in the list with a comma; for example: key1, key2, key3 Copy Also refer to the agent attribute rules. Transaction tracer These options are set in the transaction_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_tracer prefixed system property. Transaction tracing captures deep information about slow transactions and sends this to the New Relic service. The transaction includes the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true The transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent will capture the EXPLAIN plan for slow queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL. explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Threshold in seconds for query execution time below which the slow query and the EXPLAIN plan (if supported) will not be captured. Relevant to slow queries only when record_sql is set to raw or obfuscated. Relevant to EXPLAIN plans only when explain_enabled is set to true. insert_sql_max_length Type Integer Default 2000 The character limit for the SQL query string. If you have many slow SQL queries with large chunks of information, this could negatively affect performance or how quickly you see your data in New Relic. Increase the value gradually until you find the right balance of information and performance. log_sql Type Boolean Default false Set to true to enable logging of queries to the agent log file instead of uploading to New Relic. Queries are logged using the record_sql mode. record_sql Type String Default obfuscated When the transaction tracer is on, query statements can optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes: off: Send no queries. raw: Send the query statement in its original form. obfuscated: Strips out numeric and string literals. stack_based_naming (Play 2.x+ only) Type Boolean Default False Defaulted to true until Java agent version 3.12.1, when it was changed to false. This option is for Play 2.x+ only. Play/Scala instrumentation can use Thread.getStackTrace() to improve tracer naming, but at the cost of increased overhead. stack_trace_threshold Type Integer Default 0.5 Defines a threshold (in seconds) for collecting stack traces from an SQL call. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent will capture the current stack trace. This is useful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Use this setting to control the variety of your transaction traces. top_n is an integer that represents the number of unique, slow transactions that traces will be created for. If you want transaction traces to more accurately reflect the actual slowest transactions in your app, make this value lower. If you want to sample a more diverse array of transactions, make the value higher. A value of 0 would mean that only the slowest transaction is always traced. This is considered not to be optimal, though, because you may have one or two transactions that are always the slowest, and repeatedly seeing those same transaction traces will probably not give you much value. If the same transaction is often the slowest, the top_n setting allows the Java agent (over time) to sample the slowest n transactions. This gives you greater variety and more insight into your application. transaction_threshold Type String (float) Default apdex_f The time threshold used to determine when a transaction is eligible to be traced. When the transaction's response time exceeds this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to New Relic. The default is apdex_f (default), which sets the threshold to be the \"Frustrated\" Apdex level (four times the apdex_t value). You can also set a specific time threshold by entering a float value that represents a number of seconds. slow_query_whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use collect_slow_queries_from. By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: slow_query_whitelist: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy collect_slow_queries_from Type String Default (none) By default, high security mode does not allow the agent to collect slow queries. Enable this option to collect Cassandra queries from the DataStax driver, even with high security enabled. If you don't use high security, the agent collects slow queries automatically. For DataStax driver 2.1.2, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-2.1.2' Copy For DataStax driver 3.0.0, add this rule to your allow list: transaction_tracer: collect_slow_queries_from: 'com.newrelic.instrumentation.cassandra-datastax-3.0.0' Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this property (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. token_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of Tokens that can be created per Transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. segment_limit Type Integer Default 3000 Limits the number of segments that can be created per transaction. Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and the amount of data sent to New Relic. Transaction segments These options are set in the transaction_segments stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_segments prefixed system property. Transaction segments represent discrete pieces of work (generally method calls) and are displayed within transaction traces. Important Transaction segment attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction segments. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction segments regardless on how this property (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction segments, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction segments. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Browser monitoring These options are set in the browser_monitoring stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.browser_monitoring prefixed system property. Browser monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior. disabled_auto_pages Type Comma-separated list of strings Default (none) When auto_instrument is true, by default all pages are instrumented. List all pages that you want the auto instrumentation to skip here. You can still use manual instrumentation on these pages. For example: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data you can query. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how this property under browser_monitoring is set. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. External tracer The external tracing options are set in the external_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.external_tracer prefixed system property. exclude_request_uri Type Boolean Default false This setting can be used to control the collection of outgoing request URIs for errors and transaction traces. Set this to true to disable collecting this information. Cross application tracer The cross application tracing options are set in the cross_application_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.cross_application_tracer prefixed system property. Cross application tracing adds request and response headers to external calls using the Apache HttpClient libraries. This provides better performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents. enabled Type Boolean Default true Cross application tracing is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off. Error collector These options are set in the error_collector stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.error_collector prefixed system property. The error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic for viewing. Tip For how to configure errors for the Java agent, including how to configure errors via the UI, see Java agent error configuration. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable error collection. ignore_classes Type Stanza containing a list of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Specified exception class names will be ignored and will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy ignore_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a list of messages per error class Default (none) Specify exception class names the agent should ignore. Ignored messages will not affect error rate or Apdex score, or be reported to APM. Contains yaml pairs consisting of: A fully qualified exception class name that should not be reported to APM AND A list of exception messages to match against (at least one is required) If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be ignored. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some error message to ignore\" - \"Some other error message to ignore\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different error message to ignore\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list exception class names and messages you want to be ignored: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy ignore_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default 404 A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes that should not be treated as errors. If this property is commented out in the newrelic.yml configuration file, then the 404 status code will automatically be ignored. When using server-side configuration, the status code 404 must be specified in order for it to be ignored. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: ignore_status_codes: 404,507-511 Copy ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default false With default ignoreErrorPriority as false, the agent reports the last error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. If set to true, the agent reports the first error noticed if noticeError() is called multiple times in a transaction. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: true Copy expected_classes Type Stanza containing a List of fully qualified class_name strings Default (none) Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_classes: - \"com.example.MyException\" - \"com.example.DifferentException\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_CLASSES=\"[\\\"com.example.MyException\\\", \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\"]\" Copy expected_messages Type Stanza containing a fully qualified class_name and a List of messages per error class Default (none) Contains yaml pairs consisting of a fully qualified exception class name that should be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score and a List of exception messages to match against, the latter of which at least one is required. If the exception class name matches an error but the message does not, then that error will not be marked as expected and therefore will affect error rate and Apdex score. Message strings use contains for matching. A message cannot be provided on its own and must always be paired with a fully qualified class name. Cannot be specified by system property. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_messages: com.example.MyException: - \"Some expected error message\" - \"Some other expected error message\" com.example.DifferentException: - \"Some different expected error message\" Copy An environment variable can be used to list expected exception class names and messages: NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_MESSAGES=\"{\\\"com.example.MyException\\\": [\\\"Some error message to ignore\\\", \\\"Some other error message to ignore\\\"], \\\"com.example.DifferentException\\\": [\\\"Some different error message to ignore\\\"]}\" Copy expected_status_codes Type Comma-separated list of strings and ranges Default (none) A comma-separated list comprised of individual and dashed ranges of HTTP status codes to be marked as expected and thus prevented from affecting error rate or Apdex score. This setting is dynamic, so running agents will notice changes to newrelic.yml without a JVM restart. For example: error_collector: expected_status_codes: 415,500-506 Copy attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set under error_collector. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. ignoreErrorPriority Type Boolean Default true When multiple errors are noticed in a transaction, only the last error will be reported by default. Setting this property to false will instead report only the first error that is noticed. For more information, see the noticeError API. For example: error_collector: ignoreErrorPriority: false Copy ignore_errors (DEPRECATED) Type Comma-separated list of Strings Default (none) All specified exception class names specified will not be treated as errors. Deprecated as of Java agent 3.40.0 and replaced by ignore_classes. For example: error_collector: ignore_errors: some.other.MyException Copy Strip exceptions These options are set in the strip_exception_messages stanza and unless noted otherwise can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.strip_exception_messages​prefixed system property. This configuration can be enabled to control whether Java exception messages are reported to New Relic. enabled Type Boolean Default false By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you set this to true, the agent strips the messages from exceptions in order to prevent it from inadvertently capturing sensitive information. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages from specific exceptions, add the exceptions to your allow list. whitelist (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Important This config has been deprecated as of agent version 5.10.0 and will be removed in a future agent version. Instead use allowed_classes. If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to the whitelist, separated by a comma. allowed_classes Type String Default (none) If you set enabled to true but you want the agent to capture messages for specific exceptions, add each exception to allowed_classes, separated by a comma. Thread profiler These options are set in the thread_profiler stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.thread_profiler prefixed system property. Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts in your application's threads as they run. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the thread profiler. Transaction events These options are set in the transaction_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.transaction_events prefixed system property. Transaction events provide the data for displaying histograms and percentiles in the UI. Important Previously this stanza was called analytics_events. If your configuration file still uses analytics_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable the transaction events service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled transaction events reported every 60 seconds. custom_request_headers Type List of maps Default None Important Unlike other settings, custom_request_headers have to be paired together and must be set in the newrelic.yml file. They can't be overwritten by Java virtual machine arguments (system property) or environment variables. A list of maps with the paired keys header_name and the optional header_alias. Choose one or more custom HTTP request headers to add as transaction attributes. You can list multiple header configurations: transaction_events: custom_request_headers: - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-1\" - header_name: \"X-Custom-Header-2\" header_alias: \"CustomHeader2alias\" Copy In the first map set, X-Custom-Header-1 is captured and reported by the agent as the header name for a corresponding value from the request object. The header_name will also be the name of the attribute sent to New Relic. In the second map set, the request header is X-Custom-Header-2, but the CustomHeader2alias is the name sent to New Relic. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set under transaction_events. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events Custom events are set in the custom_insights_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.custom_insights_events prefixed system property. APM lets you record custom event data via the New Relic language agent APIs, which you can then query. Important For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, the following YAML configuration is recognized: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy For agent versions 4.1.0 and above, the YAML configuration uses the nested stanza formatting: custom_insights_events: enabled: false max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true This enables the custom event service. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default/Max 10000 The maximum number of sampled custom events reported every 60 seconds. Hostname configuration These options are set in the process_host stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.process_host prefixed system property. These properties are used for configuring the hostname displayed in the UI: display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type String Default 4 If the hostname cannot be determined, then the IP address of the host will be used. This property determines whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address should be used. The default is IPv4. Custom instrumentation These options set in the class_transformer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.class_transformer prefixed system property. trace_annotation_class_name Type String Default (none) String containing the full class name of the annotation class the agent uses to determine which user-specified methods to instrument. For more information about custom annotations, see Java custom metric collection. com.newrelic.instrumentation.servlet-user Type Boolean Default false Enable this option to capture the userPrincipal name. This name is included as a transaction trace attribute, and can be queried. System properties You can override any setting in the newrelic.yml file by setting a system property. The system property corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by newrelic.config. For example, the system property for the log_level setting is newrelic.config.log_level. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the system property for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is newrelic.config.transaction_tracer.enabled. In addition to overriding configuration settings, the following system properties are recognized by the agent: newrelic.config.process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. Requires Java agent 3.17 or higher. newrelic.config.file Type String Default (none) String containing a fully qualified path to the newrelic configuration file. If empty, the agent assumes newrelic.yml is in the same directory as newrelic.jar. newrelic.debug Type Boolean Default (none) Enable debug logging. newrelic.environment Type String Default (none) String containing the environment configuration for the agent to use. newrelic.home Type String Default (none) String containing the home directory of agent. This defaults to the same directory as the agent jarfile. newrelic.logfile Type String Default newrelic_agent.log String containing the name of the agent log file. Environment variables Environment variables take the highest precedence and override the system properties and yml config settings. To set environment variables, use the export VARNAME=value command. To permanently set environment variables, add the export line to a file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. You can override any setting from a system property or in the newrelic.yml by setting an environment variable. The environment variable corresponding to a given setting in the config file is the setting name prefixed by NEW_RELIC with all dots (.) and dashes (-) replaced by underscores (_). For example, the environment variable for the log_level setting is NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL. For settings nested in stanzas, prepend the stanza name to the setting name. For example, the environment variable for the enabled setting in the transaction_tracer stanza is NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED. Important Agent configuration via environment variables requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. For agent versions older than 4.10.0 the following environment variables are available: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains the application name under which to report data to New Relic. Set the name of your application as you want it to appear in New Relic. If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application. Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application. To report data to more than one application, separate the application names with a semicolon ;. For example, to report data to My Application and My Application 2: app_name: My Application;My Application 2 Copy For more methods of naming your application, see Name your Java application. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Type String Default false Enables distributed tracing. Case sensitive: use true or false. For more information, see the distributed tracing section. NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Type String Default (none) Set a display name to decorate the \"host:port\" label in the New Relic UI. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) This setting is required. Contains your New Relic account license. You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account. This key binds your agent's data to your account in the New Relic service. NEW_RELIC_LOG Type String Default newrelic_agent.log The unqualified log file name or the string STDOUT which will log to standard out. Cloud platform utilization These options are set in the utilization stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.utilization prefixed system property. The agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances and Docker containers. detect_aws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detect_docker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. Async instrumentation These options are set directly in the common stanza and can be overridden by using a prefixed system property. token_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 180 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically expire an async token that has not been explicitly expired with token.expire(). For usage instructions, see Tokens: Connect async threads. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to unexpired tokens. segment_timeout Type Integer Default (seconds) 600 The number of seconds after which the agent will automatically end a segment that has not been explicitly ended with segment.end() or segment.ignore(). For usage instructions, see Segments: Time arbitrary async activity. Important Increasing this value may impact performance, because it increases the amount of memory the agent uses and prevents transactions from being reported due to un-ended segments. Circuit breaker These settings customize the behavior of the Java circuit breaker. These settings are not included in newrelic.yml by default. You do not need to restart your JVM after changing them. If you want to customize the circuit breaker, add the stanza under the common stanza: common: &default_settings​ ​ OTHER_CONFIG_SETTINGS circuitbreaker: enabled: true memory_threshold: 20 gc_cpu_threshold: 10 Copy enabled Type Boolean Default true If your application is behaving as expected, you may want to disable the circuit breaker. memory_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 20 Customize the precentage of free heap memory below which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. gc_cpu_threshold Type Integer (0 to 100) Default 10 Customize the precentage of garbage collection CPU time above which the circuit breaker should trip. When the percentage of free heap memory is less than memory_threshold, and the CPU time spent doing garbage collection is greater than gc_cpu_threshold, the circuit breaker trips. In order to make the circuit breaker less likely to trip, decrease memory_threshold and/or increase gc_cpu_threshold. Adjust these values as needed, based on your application's operating performance and behavior. Message tracer These options are set in the message_tracer stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.message_tracer prefixed system property. segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Adds message properties to tracer attributes. Set this to false to turn it off. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Java agent version 4.3.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. In the config file, it can be set in the distributed_tracing stanza. It can be overridden using a newrelic.config.distributed_tracing prefixed system property. enabled Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy To enable this using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.enabled=true Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. For example, to exclude newrelic headers in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: exclude_newrelic_header: true Copy To exclude newrelic headers using a system property, you would use: -Dnewrelic.config.distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header=true Copy Infinite Tracing Important Requirements: Java Agent 5.12.1 or higher. Infinite Tracing does not work if enable_auto_app_naming is enabled. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional setting below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default None For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see find or create a Trace Observer. You can configure this via YAML: infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Copy You can also use the system property newrelic.config.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host or the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.span_events prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable span event reporting. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this property (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to New Relic in span_events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Important Span event attribute filtering requires Java agent version 4.10.0 or higher. Jar collector The Java agent collects and information about jars and their versions on the application classpath. Jar collection configuration is set in the jar_collector stanza and can be overridden by using a newrelic.config.jar_collector prefixed system property. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable jar collection and reporting. skip_temp_jars Type Boolean Default true Used to enable/disable collection of temporary jars. Temporary jars are those residing in the directory specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. jars_per_second Type Integer Default 10 The maximum number of jars to process per second. Must be positive.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "There are some messaging frameworks that New Relic doesn’t support by default. If you are interested in instrumenting these frameworks with our API here are some guidelines to follow. Typical messaging In the typical case, there is a process that produces a message and a process that consumes the message. Some useful things you could do here are below. Note you must be within a transaction for these to report. Report the producing/consuming as external You can create MessageProduceParameters and MessageConsumeParameters with relevant data and then call reportAsExternal(Params) to report the calls as externals. For example, when producing a message this would look like: MessageProduceParameters params = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"libraryName\").destinationType(NAMED_TOPIC).destinationName(\"topicName\").inboundHeaders(null).build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy A similar solution would work on the consumer side. Add message metrics/custom parameters to current transaction If there is useful information you want to add to your current transaction about the message, you can do that easily by calling our addCustomParameter() API. This looks like this: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"topic-name\", topic); Copy Pass a distributed trace payload In order to track the work across processes/services, the messaging framework must have a way to pass along metadata with the message, whether it’s via headers or some other mechanism. You can create a distributed trace payload on the producer side that can be attached to the message and read on the consumer side. You must be in a transaction for this to work. To do this you would follow a pattern like this: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void sendData(Producer producer){ final DistributedTracePayload payload = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().createDistributedTracePayload(); headers.add(new RecordHeader(\"newrelic\", payload.text().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))); data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\", headers); producer.send(data); } Copy And on the consumer side: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void processData(ConsumerRecord record){ final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelic\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This example uses Kafka, which you can instrument. Instrument Kafka message queues provides information for instrumenting. Edge cases There are some edge cases that require extra care. Below are suggestions on the best way to tackle them. Create a distributed trace payload and then receive a message The problem here is that you can’t create a distributed trace payload and then accept a distributed trace payload within the same transaction in that order. This means that there are two attempts of distributed tracing and you have to choose which one you want. If you would like to accept the second payload rather than create the first one, you need to prevent the first payload from getting created. You can remove the custom instrumentation (if that’s what’s creating the payload) or disable instrumentation via our config Batch reading messages For batch consumption of messages, there is a problem of which distributed tracing payload you accept. If you are ok with linking just one of the distributed trace payloads then you can accept any one of the payloads in the batch but that will result in the rest of the payloads getting lost. However, if you want to see all of the distributed traces then you’ll need to create a transaction per message. The second solution could incur some overhead so take that into consideration when making a decision. A solution like that would look like: public void processMessages(ConsumerRecords<String, String> records) { for(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record: records) { processRecord(record); } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRecord(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) { final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelicDTPayload\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This will only work if there isn’t a transaction already started on the thread at this time. If there is one then just accepting one payload from the batch is your only solution. Capturing the processing time of the message If you would like to capture the processing time of a message then you will need to move the processing work into a method and then trace that method. For example: public void getMessages(){ KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer(props); consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(\"topic\")); while (true) { ConsumerRecords<String, String> recs = consumer.poll(10000); if (recs.count() == 0) { } else { for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec : recs) { processRec(rec); } } } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRec(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // some processing } Copy For more help Use the Guide to using the Java agent API to learn more about our Java agent API.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic.

All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "There are some messaging frameworks that New Relic doesn’t support by default. If you are interested in instrumenting these frameworks with our API here are some guidelines to follow. Typical messaging In the typical case, there is a process that produces a message and a process that consumes the message. Some useful things you could do here are below. Note you must be within a transaction for these to report. Report the producing/consuming as external You can create MessageProduceParameters and MessageConsumeParameters with relevant data and then call reportAsExternal(Params) to report the calls as externals. For example, when producing a message this would look like: MessageProduceParameters params = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"libraryName\").destinationType(NAMED_TOPIC).destinationName(\"topicName\").inboundHeaders(null).build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy A similar solution would work on the consumer side. Add message metrics/custom parameters to current transaction If there is useful information you want to add to your current transaction about the message, you can do that easily by calling our addCustomParameter() API. This looks like this: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"topic-name\", topic); Copy Pass a distributed trace payload In order to track the work across processes/services, the messaging framework must have a way to pass along metadata with the message, whether it’s via headers or some other mechanism. You can create a distributed trace payload on the producer side that can be attached to the message and read on the consumer side. You must be in a transaction for this to work. To do this you would follow a pattern like this: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void sendData(Producer producer){ final DistributedTracePayload payload = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().createDistributedTracePayload(); headers.add(new RecordHeader(\"newrelic\", payload.text().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))); data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\", headers); producer.send(data); } Copy And on the consumer side: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void processData(ConsumerRecord record){ final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelic\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This example uses Kafka, which you can instrument. Instrument Kafka message queues provides information for instrumenting. Edge cases There are some edge cases that require extra care. Below are suggestions on the best way to tackle them. Create a distributed trace payload and then receive a message The problem here is that you can’t create a distributed trace payload and then accept a distributed trace payload within the same transaction in that order. This means that there are two attempts of distributed tracing and you have to choose which one you want. If you would like to accept the second payload rather than create the first one, you need to prevent the first payload from getting created. You can remove the custom instrumentation (if that’s what’s creating the payload) or disable instrumentation via our config Batch reading messages For batch consumption of messages, there is a problem of which distributed tracing payload you accept. If you are ok with linking just one of the distributed trace payloads then you can accept any one of the payloads in the batch but that will result in the rest of the payloads getting lost. However, if you want to see all of the distributed traces then you’ll need to create a transaction per message. The second solution could incur some overhead so take that into consideration when making a decision. A solution like that would look like: public void processMessages(ConsumerRecords<String, String> records) { for(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record: records) { processRecord(record); } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRecord(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) { final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelicDTPayload\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This will only work if there isn’t a transaction already started on the thread at this time. If there is one then just accepting one payload from the batch is your only solution. Capturing the processing time of the message If you would like to capture the processing time of a message then you will need to move the processing work into a method and then trace that method. For example: public void getMessages(){ KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer(props); consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(\"topic\")); while (true) { ConsumerRecords<String, String> recs = consumer.poll(10000); if (recs.count() == 0) { } else { for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec : recs) { processRec(rec); } } } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRec(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // some processing } Copy For more help Use the Guide to using the Java agent API to learn more about our Java agent API.",

Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent is compatible with Scala, and supports New Relic API calls, annotations, and custom instrumentation. All information below is supplemental to New Relic's Java agent installation directions. Tip For Heroku, see Java agent with Scala on Heroku. Scala frameworks If your framework is not natively supported by New Relic, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, custom instrumentation is a great way to dig deeper into your application. Instrument Scala with the Scala API The New Relic Scala agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent using idiomatic Scala code. It can be used alongside the New Relic Java API as well as allow users to Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous anonymous functions Create segments for synchronous and asynchronous code blocks Create a transaction if one has not already been started Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. The New Relic Scala API requires Java agent 7.1.0 or higher. Use the Scala API To access the API class add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing S.V with the Scala version and X.Y.Z with theJava agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-scala-api_S.V\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Supported Scala versions are 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 3.0 users can use the 2.13 jar. The jar is deployed to Maven Central and it is also in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The underlying API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent is running. Segments To create segment for a synchronous code block use TraceOps.trace. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace trace(\"statement segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } // trace can also be used as an expression val x: Int = trace(\"expression segment\") { val i = 1 val j = 2 i + j } println(x) // 2 Copy trace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.trace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Option[Int] = for { one <- trace(\"segment one\")(Option(1)) two <- trace(\"segment two\")(Option(one + 1)) three <- trace(\"segment three\")(Option(two + 1)) } yield three println(x) // Some(3) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous code block containing a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the Future to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = asyncTrace(\"segment name\")(Future { Thread.sleep(5000) 1 }) x.foreach(println) // prints 1 on completion of Future Copy asyncTrace can also be used in Scala For comprehensions import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTrace // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy If you want to create segment for a synchronous anonymous function use TraceOps.traceFun. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.traceFun val x: Option[Int] = Option(1) .map(traceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => i + 1)) println(x) //Some(2) Copy If you want to create segment for an asynchronous function that returns a Scala Future use TraceOps.asyncTrace. This will ensure the timing for the segment includes the time taken for the function to complete. In the example below segment time will be no less than 5 seconds due to the delay created in the wrapped Future. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.asyncTraceFun // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = Future(1) .flatMap(asyncTraceFun(\"statement segment\")(i => Future(i + 1))) x.foreach(println) // prints 2 on completion of Future Copy Transactions Transactions can be created using the TraceOps.txn method. For example: import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn txn { val i = 1 val j = 2 println(i + j) } Copy txn can be used as a statement (as above) or as an expression import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.txn val i: Int = txn(1 + 2) //transaction created println(i) // 3 Copy txn can be used with any of the TraceOp methods to create segments. The example below create a transaction with 3 segments. import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future} import com.newrelic.scala.api.TraceOps.{txn, asyncTrace} // implicit execution implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ??? val x: Future[Int] = txn( for { one <- asyncTrace(\"segment one\")(Future(1)) two <- asyncTrace(\"segment two\")(Future(one + 1)) three <- asyncTrace(\"segment three\")(Future(two + 1)) } yield three ) x.foreach(println) // prints 3 on completion of Future Copy Instrument Scala with the Java agent API Instrument Scala to use the New Relic API class or annotations. Add the following information to your Scala configuration file: Configure using the project/build.scala file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to the appDependencies method in your application's project/build.scala file: \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Configure using the project/build.sbt file Add the following line (replacing X.Y.Z with the Java agent version you use) to your application's project/build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\" Copy Import the NewRelic class and use it in your application: import com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic ... NewRelic.setTransactionName(null, \"/myTransaction\"); Copy More API functions For more about the Java agent API and its functionality, see the Java agent API introduction. Instrument Scala with XML instrumentation XML instrumentation is available for any Scala application running with the Java agent. It allows instrumentation to be added without any changes to the code. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML.

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

To request instance-level information from additional datastores, get support at support.newrelic.com. Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's Java agent to collect and view additional metrics provided by the most common application servers via JMX. The collected metrics vary by app server and include measurements of thread pools, HTTP sessions, and transactions. View JVM metrics Application servers collect and report different metrics, which appear on APM's JVMs page. (For applications using New Relic via Heroku, the JVMs page is named Instances.) At a minimum, each app server collects and reports metric data on memory. For instructions on enabling JMX metrics, refer to your app server's documentation. To view JVM metrics: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs > (select a JVM). From the selected JVM's Memory page, use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. To view other metrics, select any available tab. Optional: To use the thread profiler to look for bottlenecks in data on executing threads, select Profile this JVM. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs: Depending on the metrics your app server is reporting, one or more tabs appear on your JVM page. Tabs available by app server This table lists which tabs appear on the JVM page for app servers. If your app server does not report a particular type of metric data, the tab does not appear on your JVM page. App server Memory Thread pools HTTP sessions App server transactions Data sources Glassfish JBoss 5AS JBoss 6AS JBoss 6EAP JBoss 7AS Jetty Resin 3 Resin 4 Tomcat TomEE WebLogic Websphere Liberty Websphere Traditional WildFly Metrics available by tab Here is a summary of the metrics available from the JVM page. If the app server does not support a particular metric, that tab does not appear on your JVM page. JMX Metric charts Memory Heap memory usage: Each chart shows the used and committed heap space in MB for a given heap. Non-heap memory pool usage for the JVM: The used code cache and used CMS Perm Gen in MB. Garbage collection: The garbage collection CPU time. Class count: The loaded and unloaded class count for the JVM. Threads Thread count: The current number of active threads in the JVM. Thread pool: The active and idle thread count for the pool. On supported app servers, a chart shows each thread pool present in the app server, as well as the ratio of active to maximum thread count for each thread pool. HTTP sessions Session: The active, invalidated by timeout, and invalidated HTTP session counts for the application. On supported app servers, a chart shows each application present in the app server. App server transactions Active transaction: The number of active transactions within the app server's transaction manager. Created transaction: The change in the total number of created transactions per app server. Some app servers separate top level transactions and nested transactions. Finished transaction: The change in the total number of finished transactions per app server. Some app servers separate them by aborted and committed completed transactions. Data sources The metrics for the data source tab vary by app server. For more details, see Data source metrics by app server. For details on WebLogic's data source metrics, see WebLogic JMX metrics. Data source metrics by app server For supported app servers, the agent collects JMX data source metrics. You can view these metrics at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > JVMs > Data sources. To see these metrics, ensure that your data source has been properly configured for JMX monitoring for your app server. App server Metrics Tomcat Max connections: The maximum connections available for a data source. This is generally a configurable parameter. Active connections: The current number of active connections in a data source. Idle connections: The current number of idle connections in a data source. WebSphere Liberty Max connections: The maximum connections available for a data source. This is generally a configurable parameter. Active connections: The current number of active connections in a data source. Idle connections: The current number of idle connections in a data source. Wait time: The average amount of time a connections needs to wait before being handled. Destroyed connections: The number of destroyed connections. Resin Max connections: The maximum connections available for a data source. This is generally a configurable parameter. Active connections: The current number of active connections in a data source. Idle connections: The current number of idle connections in a data source. Created connections: The number of created connections. Enable for Spring Boot 2.2 and higher with Tomcat To enable New Relic to access Tomcat JMX metrics when running with Spring Boot 2.2 and higher, the system property server.tomcat.mbeanregistry.enabled must be set to true. See the Spring Boot 2.2 release notes. Enable WebSphere PMI metrics To enable New Relic to access WebSphere PMI metrics, you will need to configure WebSphere to monitor the necessary statistic sets. Enable all statistic sets (recommended) The simplest approach is to enable the collection of all statistic sets: If you are using Java 2 Security, ensure you have granted New Relic proper permissions. From the WebSphere admin console, select Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) > (your server name). Select the Enable Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) checkbox. In the Currently monitored statistic set section, select All, then save your changes. Enable custom statistic sets (advanced) You can also collect only the PMI metrics that New Relic monitors by default. To collect only some PMI metrics: If you are using Java 2 Security, ensure you have granted New Relic proper permissions. From the WebSphere admin console, select Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) > (selected app server). Select the Enable Performance Monitoring Infrastructure (PMI) checkbox. Select Custom. From the custom statistic set list, enable the following metrics: In the ThreadPool category, select the ActiveCount and PoolSize checkboxes. In the Servlet Session Manager category, select the ActiveCount and LiveCount checkboxes. In the Transaction Manager category, select the CommittedCount, RolledbackCount, and GlobalTimeoutCount checkboxes. From the Messages panel, select Save directly to the master configuration. Collected WebSphere PMI metrics When enabled, New Relic collects the following WebSphere PMI metrics. If you want other PMI metrics besides these to be collected and displayed in New Relic custom dashboards, use JMX instrumentation. stats.ActiveCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.ActiveCount Object name pattern WebSphere:type=ThreadPool,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/ThreadPool/WebContainer/Active Copy Type Simple maximumSize WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute maximumSize Object name pattern WebSphere:type=ThreadPool,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/ThreadPool/WebContainer/Max Copy Type Simple stats.CommittedCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.CommittedCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Committed Copy Type Simple stats.RolledbackCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.RolledbackCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Rolled Back Copy Type Simple stats.GlobalTimeoutCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.GlobalTimeoutCount Object name pattern WebSphere:j2eeType=JTAResource,type=TransactionService,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/JTA/TransactionService/Timed Out Copy Type Simple stats.LiveCount WebSphere PMI metrics Details Attribute stats.GlobalTimeoutCount Object name pattern WebSphere:type=SessionManager,name=*,process=*,platform=*,node=*,* Copy New Relic metric JmxBuiltIn/Session/DefaultApplication#DefaultWebApplication.war/Active Copy Type Simple WebLogic JMX metrics In WebLogic, JMX is enabled by default.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "This is an example of a custom JMX YAML file for New Relic's Java agent, including value and definition, MBean, attributes, type, and names for metrics, objects, and attributes. For more information, including a video, see Custom JMX monitoring by YAML. Contents YAML example Here is an example of a custom JMX YAML file. YAML files are space senstive. name: TomcatCustom version: 1.0 enabled: true jmx: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 metrics: - attributes: bufferSize, maxHeaderCount - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* metrics: - attributes: Count type: monotonically_increasing Copy Example explanation Properties Value Definition name A descriptive name identifying your YAML custom instrumentation file, using one space before the property name. In the above example, the name is TomcatCustom. version The version of the extension file. Use a double. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Use one space before the property version. In the above example, the version is 1.0. enabled If true, the Java agent will read the extension. If false, the Java agent will ignore the extension. Use one space before the property enabled. The above example is enabled. MBeans Each line in the YAML starting with - object_name represents an MBean. For example, the following lines describe the information to be pulled from the first MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple Copy The object_name property itself can match one or more MBeans. For example, the line below only matches one MBean: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Copy The following line could match multiple MBeans: - object_name: java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy The asterisk ( * ) wildcard can only be used with JDK 1.6 and higher. The three MBeans listed in the above example have the following object names: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples Catalina:type=Connector,port=8009 java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=* Copy Attributes The JMX example retrieves six different attributes from the three MBeans. New Relic's Java agent pulls these attributes from the first MBean: accessCount cacheSize hitsCount The agent pulls these attributes from the second MBean: bufferSize maxHeaderCount The agent pulls one attribute (Count) from third MBean. Type For type, use simple or monotonically_increasing. When type is not specified in the JMX YAML file, it defaults to monotonically_increasing. Value Definition simple The exact value of the attribute will be reported to New Relic each minute. monotonically_increasing The positive difference will be reported to New Relic each minute. In the example above, the attributes accessCount, cacheSize, and hitsCount will be reported as simple. The attributes bufferSize, maxHeaderCount, and Count will be reported as monotonically_increasing. If the hitsCount attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 5 each minute. If the Count attribute value is always 5, then New Relic will report a 0 for the value each minute. If the Count attribute value changes from 5 to 7, then New Relic will report a 2 for that minute. Metric names When selecting custom dashboard metrics and not using the property root_metric_name, use the following format for all custom JMX metrics: JMX/beginning_of_object_name/type/any_properties_in_object_name/attribute_name Copy Tip Some object names do not include a type. In that case, a null will be present in the metric name. The configuration file does not use root_metric_name, so the following metrics will be created: JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/accessCount JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/cacheSize JMX/Catalina/Cache/localhost/examples/hitsCount JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/bufferSize JMX/Catalina/Connector/8009/maxHeaderCount JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/direct/Count JMX/java.nio/BufferPool/mapped/Count Copy If you are using the property root_metric_name, then the metric will be your root metric name prefixed with JMX and followed by the attribute's name. You can use object name values by specifying the object name key in the root_metric_name between brackets {}. For example: Part of a configuration file: - object_name: Catalina:type=Cache,host=localhost,path=/examples root_metric_name: Tomcat/{host} metrics: - attributes: accessCount, cacheSize, hitsCount type: simple - object_name: mbean:type=Sample,host=localhost,path=* root_metric_name: SampleMBean metrics: - attributes: attOne, attTwo type: simple Copy Metric names: JMX/Tomcat/localhost/accessCount JMX/Tomcat/localhost/cacheSize JMX/Tomcat/localhost/hitsCount JMX/SampleMBean/attOne JMX/SampleMBean/attTwo Copy If an attribute does not actually exist on the MBean, then the metric will never appear in New Relic. Finding object and attribute names The easiest way to find available MBeans and its associated attributes is to use the JConsole instructions for JDK 1.6.

      "body": "There are some messaging frameworks that New Relic doesn’t support by default. If you are interested in instrumenting these frameworks with our API here are some guidelines to follow. Typical messaging In the typical case, there is a process that produces a message and a process that consumes the message. Some useful things you could do here are below. Note you must be within a transaction for these to report. Report the producing/consuming as external You can create MessageProduceParameters and MessageConsumeParameters with relevant data and then call reportAsExternal(Params) to report the calls as externals. For example, when producing a message this would look like: MessageProduceParameters params = MessageProduceParameters.library(\"libraryName\").destinationType(NAMED_TOPIC).destinationName(\"topicName\").inboundHeaders(null).build(); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getTracedMethod().reportAsExternal(params); Copy A similar solution would work on the consumer side. Add message metrics/custom parameters to current transaction If there is useful information you want to add to your current transaction about the message, you can do that easily by calling our addCustomParameter() API. This looks like this: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"topic-name\", topic); Copy Pass a distributed trace payload In order to track the work across processes/services, the messaging framework must have a way to pass along metadata with the message, whether it’s via headers or some other mechanism. You can create a distributed trace payload on the producer side that can be attached to the message and read on the consumer side. You must be in a transaction for this to work. To do this you would follow a pattern like this: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void sendData(Producer producer){ final DistributedTracePayload payload = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().createDistributedTracePayload(); headers.add(new RecordHeader(\"newrelic\", payload.text().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))); data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\", headers); producer.send(data); } Copy And on the consumer side: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public void processData(ConsumerRecord record){ final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelic\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This example uses Kafka, which you can instrument. Instrument Kafka message queues provides information for instrumenting. Edge cases There are some edge cases that require extra care. Below are suggestions on the best way to tackle them. Create a distributed trace payload and then receive a message The problem here is that you can’t create a distributed trace payload and then accept a distributed trace payload within the same transaction in that order. This means that there are two attempts of distributed tracing and you have to choose which one you want. If you would like to accept the second payload rather than create the first one, you need to prevent the first payload from getting created. You can remove the custom instrumentation (if that’s what’s creating the payload) or disable instrumentation via our config Batch reading messages For batch consumption of messages, there is a problem of which distributed tracing payload you accept. If you are ok with linking just one of the distributed trace payloads then you can accept any one of the payloads in the batch but that will result in the rest of the payloads getting lost. However, if you want to see all of the distributed traces then you’ll need to create a transaction per message. The second solution could incur some overhead so take that into consideration when making a decision. A solution like that would look like: public void processMessages(ConsumerRecords<String, String> records) { for(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record: records) { processRecord(record); } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRecord(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) { final Iterator<Header> nrHeaders = record.headers().headers(\"newrelicDTPayload\").iterator(); if (nrHeaders.hasNext()) { final Header nrHeader = nrHeaders.next(); final String payload = new String(nrHeader.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload); } } Copy This will only work if there isn’t a transaction already started on the thread at this time. If there is one then just accepting one payload from the batch is your only solution. Capturing the processing time of the message If you would like to capture the processing time of a message then you will need to move the processing work into a method and then trace that method. For example: public void getMessages(){ KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer(props); consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList(\"topic\")); while (true) { ConsumerRecords<String, String> recs = consumer.poll(10000); if (recs.count() == 0) { } else { for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec : recs) { processRec(rec); } } } } @Trace(dispatcher = true) private void processRec(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // some processing } Copy For more help Use the Guide to using the Java agent API to learn more about our Java agent API.",

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Tip For non-Scala installations, see Java agent and Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic add-on After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you complete the requirements and enable the New Relic add-on, configure your Scala Heroku environment for New Relic: Edit your Procfile to point to the agent jar in your app's root folder. Replace the contents of the file, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest agent version: web: target/universal/stage/bin/play-getting-started -Dhttp.port=${PORT} -J-javaagent:/app/target/universal/stage/lib/com.newrelic.agent.java.newrelic-agent-X.Y.Z.jar -J-Dnewrelic.config.file=conf/newrelic.yml Copy OR Identify the path to newrelic.jar with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. Edit your build.sbt. Call the agent, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version: Custom build.sbt name := \"\"\"play-getting-started\"\"\" version := \"1.0-SNAPSHOT\" lazy val root = (project in file(\".\")).enablePlugins(PlayScala) scalaVersion := \"2.11.7\" libraryDependencies ++= Seq( jdbc, cache, \"org.postgresql\" % \"postgresql\" % \"9.4-1201-jdbc41\", ws ) libraryDependencies <+= scalaVersion(\"org.scala-lang\" % \"scala-compiler\" % _ ) libraryDependencies ++= Seq(\"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-agent\" % \"X.Y.Z\") libraryDependencies ++= Seq(\"com.newrelic.agent.java\" % \"newrelic-api\" % \"X.Y.Z\") Copy Download a customized newrelic.yml file from your APM account settings: How to download a custom newrelic.yml Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. Get the New Relic Java agent. Unzip the downloaded file. Copy newrelic.yml to the scala-getting-started/conf directory: Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name.

      "body": "With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code. Every minute the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where the owner of that data can sign in and use the data to see how their website is performing. Installation To use the Java agent: Make sure your system meets the Java agent's compatibility and requirements. Sign up for a New Relic account. Install the Java agent using our launcher, or by following the standard installation procedures. Depending on your tools and frameworks, refer to additional installation procedures to install or configure the Java agent. Read the install docs Add Java data To view your app's performance in the New Relic UI, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary. The APM user interface includes a dedicated JVM metrics page, transaction and error details, a thread profiler tool to sample Java threads and report stack traces, and more. You can also extend your agent instrumentation and explore your data with other New Relic products, including New Relic One's data explorer and dashboards. Startup configuration The Java agent reads the startup configuration from the newrelic.yml file, which must be in the same directory as newrelic.jar. You can also override settings using Java system properties. The agent needs the license_key and app_name settings at startup (bootstrap). You can customize the location of the log file and other settings in your newrelic.yml file. In addition, you can adjust the naming configuration if your app server runs multiple applications in the same JVM. Configuration options You can configure application reporting from the New Relic web interface using server-side configuration. Changes will be applied to all agents reporting for your application when the JVM restarts. However, if you use server-side configuration, you must still maintain required settings (license_key and app_name) in the local config file. Both transaction traces and error snapshots can optionally record HTTP parameters. Sometimes HTTP parameters contain sensitive information, such as a credit card number. The agent has several configuration options to ensure data security, such as collecting HTTP parameters but excluding certain named parameters. Additional instrumentation After installing the Java agent, use any of these methods to extend your instrumentation: Custom instrumentation: Implement Java custom instrumentation via annotation or XML. Enable distributed tracing: See the paths of your requests as they spread across a distributed, multiple-services architecture. Collect custom attributes: Collect custom attributes via API or XML file. Java agent API: Use the API to control, customize, or extend the functionality of the Java agent. Browser instrumentation: Integrate the Java agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation: Use a circuit breaker to protect applications from over-instrumentation. Custom JMX instrumentation by YAML: View custom JMX metrics with a YAML custom instrumentation file. JVM metrics page: Collect metrics from the most common application servers through JMX. Open source telemetry: We offer a variety of tools, such as Kamon Reporter, OpenTelemetry exporter, Micrometer metrics registry, and Java Telemetry SDK. When to restart your JVM When you make a change to your configuration or to your custom XML, in almost all cases you must restart your JVM. There are only four situations where a restart is not necessary: JVM restart is not required for... Comments Log level or audit mode changes If you are simply changing the log_level or audit_mode in the Java agent configuration file, you do not need to restart the JVM. Custom instrumentation XML file JVM restart depends on your Java agent version: 3.15.0 or higher: If you are updating a custom instrumentation XML file in the extensions folder, the updates will be reloaded automatically within a minute. Java agent versions lower than 3.15.0: If you using an agent version earlier than 3.15.0, you must restart the JVM. Circuit breaker changes If you are changing the circuit breaker for Java custom instrumentation, a JVM restart is not required. Ignored or expected errors If you are ignoring or expecting errors by configuring the newrelic.yml file, a JVM restart is not required. This includes adding status codes or classes to the newrelic.yml file when using the Java agent version 3.40.0 or higher. For example: ignore_status_codes expected_status_codes ignore_classes ignore_messages expected_classes expected_messages All other changes require an agent restart, which means restarting the JVM. JSR 163 compliance The New Relic Java agent monitors web transactions, receiving information about them and communicating that information to the New Relic user interface with strong data security measures in place. The agent is packaged as a JSR 163 compliant javaagent that is activated by the JVM through modifications to the JVM launch. Once activated, the agent inserts itself into the class loading stream and instruments class methods using byte code instrumentation (bci). Designed to have minimal impact on your web application, all of the classes are in the newrelic package namespace so they do not collide with your own classes. The agent uses the ASM bci engine to insert software probes. The agent receives basic information about your host environment, such as operating system, Java version, system properties, and your New Relic configuration file. The agent also polls data from the JVM and from JMX. Troubleshooting procedures If you encounter problems with the Java agent, see the troubleshooting documentation.",

To request instance-level information from additional datastores, get support at support.newrelic.com. Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM or browser monitoring. Tip If you use Scala, see Java agent Scala procedures for Heroku. Compatibility and requirements Java 7 or higher Maven 3 or higher (if you are using Maven) Latest New Relic Java agent version 1. Enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku After you ensure that you meet the requirements, enable the New Relic agent add-on in Heroku. Caution You must deploy your Java app to Heroku, following the Heroku instructions at least through the Deploy the app step, before you can enable the New Relic agent add-on. Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com. Select your app. Select Add-ons > New Relic APM. Get the New Relic Java agent. Unzip the file into your app root. Edit newrelic.yml to customize the app_name setting with a descriptive app name. Also in newrelic.yml, add your license key to the license_key setting. 4. Push your changes and open the app After you configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, push your changes and open the app to monitor it with New Relic. Push your changes to the dyno with this Heroku toolbelt command: git add . git commit -m 'YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE' git push heroku master Copy Open your app in your browser with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku open Copy Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. Check your app's performance in Heroku by selecting your app and then selecting the New Relic add-on. If no data appears or if you have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips. Troubleshoot Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot: If you don't see the New Relic add-on after you generate traffic, go to Heroku, select Find More Add Ons, and add the APM add-on. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Heroku (Java).

Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With automatic instrumentation, the agent collects rich data out of the box, and data will show up in your New Relic dashboards within minutes of installation. Even if your library is not automatically instrumented, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation and the Java agent API. The agent automatically instruments these frameworks and libraries: App/Web servers The agent automatically instruments the following app/web servers.

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.

      "body": "To communicate with the New Relic collector over HTTPS, you need to have the proper certificates for trusted signers in the trust store on your app server. By default, most JREs contain a valid root certificate that allows the agent to connect to newrelic.com. For SSL connection issues, please visit SSL or connection errors (Java). Notice of expired SSL certificates and certificate removal Caution The SSL certificates that were bundled with Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 have expired and are no longer valid. This means that Java agent versions 6.1.0 to 6.4.2 can no longer use the certificates bundled with the agent to establish a connection with New Relic and that you must provide your own SSL certificates. Please see this community forum post for additional details. Important Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2 no longer ship with SSL certificates bundled into the agent. You must provide your own SSL truststore to the agent by explicitly using the ca_bundle_path configuration option, or by using the default truststore provided by the JDK/JRE (the agent will look to use the latter by default). Additionally the use_private_ssl configuration option has been removed from Java agent versions higher than 6.4.2. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Java Agent versions 6.2.0 - 6.4.2 Starting with Java agent version 6.2.0, the use_private_ssl configuration option has been reintroduced so you can use the SSL certificates that are bundled into the agent jar. The following bundled SSL certificates are valid for up to a year after release. META-INF/certs/eu-newrelic-com.pem META-INF/certs/eu01-nr-data-net.pem META-INF/certs/newrelic-com.pem Copy Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. When the bundled certificates expire, the Java agent will no longer be able to connect to New Relic and you must either update to the latest agent version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store can download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem use_private_ssl: false # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Summary There are two configuration settings that determine what certs are used by the agent to establish a secure connection to New Relic. They are: use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path. Here's how they work together: DEFAULT: Neither configuration option (ca_bundle_path/use_private_ssl) is provided, because both are using default values. The agent will use the default SSL certificates bundled into the Java Development Kit (JDK). If these certificates aren't present or don't include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your JDK certificate bundle. Only use_private_ssl is configured. The agent will use the SSL certificates that are bundled with it. Only ca_bundle_path is configured. The agent will try to connect using the custom SSL certificates bundle at the configured path. If the configured custom certificate bundle doesn’t include certificates that trust New Relic, then the agent will not connect. You'll need to merge valid certificates into your custom certificate bundle. Both use_private_ssl and ca_bundle_path are configured. The ca_bundle_path configuration setting takes precedence and the use_private_ssl config is ignored. This behavior is the same as only specifying ca_bundle_path. Java Agent versions 6.0.0/6.1.0 Starting in 6.0.0, the Java agent no longer includes the nrcert global certificate chain. Users wishing to add the global certificate to their local trust store must download the DigiCert Global Root CA from DigiCert. Note: In versions 6.1.0+, the Java agent will use a bundled New Relic certificate that is valid for up to a year after release. Before the certificate expires, you must either update the agent to the latest version or provide a valid certificate using the ca_bundle_path configuration. Important The Java agent will begin logging a warning message upon application startup when there are less than three months before the bundled certificate expires. Using YAML-based configuration common: default_settings ca_bundle_path: /path/to/digicert.pem # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ... Copy Java Agent versions prior to 6.0.0 (Deprecated) For Java agent versions prior to 6.0.0, applications that require valid certificates may add them in one of the following two ways: Use YAML-based configuration. Add the bundled list of New Relic trusted signers to the local store. Using YAML-based configuration The New Relic Java agent bundles the list of trusted signers in the agent newrelic.jar file. If you do not want to change the local trust store, you can activate them by setting use_private_ssl to true in the newrelic.yml agent configuration file: common: default_settings use_private_ssl: true # # ============================== LICENSE KEY =============================== # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic account ...

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Java agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Java agent release notes. These update procedures describe how to replace some of the current contents of your agent root directory, which contains the New Relic Java agent (newrelic.jar), with newly downloaded contents from the New Relic UI. Update to latest version To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run java -jar newrelic.jar -v. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console. Then, to update to the latest Java agent version: Back up the entire Java agent root directory to another location. Rename that directory to NewRelic_Agent#.#.#, where #.#.# is the agent version number. Download the agent. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy newrelic-api.jar and newrelic.jar into the original Java agent root directory. Diff your current newrelic.yml with the newly downloaded newrelic.yml from the zip, and update customized differences as needed. Restart your Java dispatcher. If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory. Update agent config differences If differences between the two versions are unrelated to your app's customizations, align the newrelic.yml you use moving forward with the latest updates to the default newrelic.yml from New Relic. For example, if you diff the default newrelic.yml files for Java agent versions 3.29.0 and 3.30.0, the results printed to the console will be: ➜ diff newrelic_3.29.0.yml newrelic_3.30.0.yml 254a255,265 > # Classes loaded by classloaders in this list will not be instrumented. > # This is a useful optimization for runtimes which use classloaders to > # load dynamic classes which the agent would not instrument. > classloader_excludes: > groovy.lang.GroovyClassLoader$InnerLoader, > org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteClassLoader, > com.collaxa.cube.engine.deployment.BPELClassLoader, > org.springframework.data.convert.ClassGeneratingEntityInstantiator$ObjectInstantiatorClassGenerator, > org.mvel2.optimizers.impl.asm.ASMAccessorOptimizer$ContextClassLoader, > gw.internal.gosu.compiler.SingleServingGosuClassLoader, > Copy These lines were added to the default newrelic.yml in Java agent version 3.30.0. If you want to run Java agent version 3.30.0 or higher, ensure you include these lines in your newrelic.yml. Java agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, New Relic will no longer accept data from Java agent versions earlier than 3.6.0, except version 2.21.7. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with New Relic's data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to the New Relic collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 5.0.0 Release notes: Java agent 5.0.0 Self installer: The New Relic Java agent's self-installer has been removed in order to provide a more consistent user experience. To install the Java agent, add the full path to the newrelic.jar to the -javaagent flag in your JVM options. For more information, see the documentation on installing the agent on specific application servers, including Docker, Maven, or Gradle. Deprecated instrumentation: The following instrumentation modules have been moved out of the default Java agent. They are now provided as a separate download. To continue using these modules, just add them to the agent's extensions directory in your New Relic folder or wherever your extensions directory is configured. Deprecated modules include: Akka 2.0 Akka 2.1 Akka-http 1.0 Akka-http 2.0 - 2.4.1 Akka-http 2.4.2 - 2.4.4 Hystrix 1.2 Hystrix 1.3 Play 1: Instrumentation for Play-1.x is not available as an extension. Play 2.0 Play 2.1 Play 2.2 Solr 3.1 - 3.4 Solr 3.5 Solr 3.6 4.12.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.12.0 Deprecated APIs: The custom transport channel API is now deprecated in favor of the distributed tracing API. The skipTransactionTrace attribute on the @Trace annotation is now deprecated. Instead, use the excludeFromTransactionTrace attribute. Deprecated instrumentation: JetS3t: Removed built-in instrumentation for JetS3t. The agent will continue to report external calls made with the JetS3t client. 4.4.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.4.0 Java 6 support removed: You must use 4.3 or earlier. EU data center: Minimum version required for use in EU datacenter. Removed the SSL configuration option: SSL is now always used in communication with New Relic servers. The newrelic.yml ssl configuration and -Dnewrelic.config.ssl system property are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than true will result in logging a warning. Legacy agent 2.21.7 Release notes: Java agent 2.21.7 Java SE 5.0: This is a bugfix release for the legacy Java SE 5.0 version of the agent. Unless you are a Java SE5 user, use the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. This affects: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, OS X Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50",

Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session.

Configure the agent Here's how to do a basic setup with agent configuration settings in newrelic.yml. Tip For an advanced installation, you can pass settings with environment variables, Java system properties, or server-side configuration. To understand the precedence of these configuration settings, see Java agent configuration: Config file. The Java agent requires the license_key and app_name settings at startup. All the other settings are optional, and you can review them in Java agent configuration: Config file. Go to the unzipped installation file, and inside the newrelic subdirectory, edit newrelic.yml: Find the line with license_key. Replace ' < %= license_key %>' with your license. For example: license_key: 456n20n1367ov2s174v51nvn789d21s67v26NRAL Copy Find the line with app_name. Replace My Application with a name that helps you identify the application. For example: app_name: Tax Calculator Copy Tip If you need tips about how to name your application, see Name your application. Add optional settings that you want, such as agent logging and distributed tracing (or add them later). Save and close newrelic.yml. 4. Install the agent The Java agent installation involves copying all the unzipped New Relic files into the directory structure of your application server/container. For example, you can create a /opt/newrelic directory, but if you want to put the files elsewhere, make sure of the following: The .jar files in the directory cannot be on the classpath. The .jar files cannot be in directories specified in java.endorsed.dirs. To install the Java agent: In your application server/container directory structure, create a directory for New Relic files (for example, /opt/newrelic). Copy all the New Relic files from your unzipped newrelic directory into your new directory. Make sure that your application server/container includes this option when it starts Java (for tips on how to do this with your tool or framework, see JVM arguments): -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Start or restart your application server/container. Generate some traffic for your app, and then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM Summary page. If nothing appears, follow the troubleshooting procedures. 5. Post-installation tasks If you are using newrelic.yml to make configuration settings, consider the following: We recommend you change the default newrelic.yml file permissions to read/write only for the owner of the application server process. As you would with other important files, be sure newrelic.yml is part of your backup routine. We recommend using New Relic Diagnostics to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy. What's next? Here are some additional topics to consider: For Docker questions, see Install New Relic Java agent for Docker. View your app in New Relic and get comfortable with the user interface. Read the documentation about APM. For example, read about the Summary page, the JVM metrics page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Query your data using NRQL (New Relic Query Language). Learn about setting up custom instrumentation and async instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default.",

We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session.

Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Java agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Java agent release notes. These update procedures describe how to replace some of the current contents of your agent root directory, which contains the New Relic Java agent (newrelic.jar), with newly downloaded contents from the New Relic UI. Update to latest version To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run java -jar newrelic.jar -v. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console. Then, to update to the latest Java agent version: Back up the entire Java agent root directory to another location. Rename that directory to NewRelic_Agent#.#.#, where #.#.# is the agent version number. Download the agent. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy newrelic-api.jar and newrelic.jar into the original Java agent root directory. Diff your current newrelic.yml with the newly downloaded newrelic.yml from the zip, and update customized differences as needed. Restart your Java dispatcher. If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory. Update agent config differences If differences between the two versions are unrelated to your app's customizations, align the newrelic.yml you use moving forward with the latest updates to the default newrelic.yml from New Relic. For example, if you diff the default newrelic.yml files for Java agent versions 3.29.0 and 3.30.0, the results printed to the console will be: ➜ diff newrelic_3.29.0.yml newrelic_3.30.0.yml 254a255,265 > # Classes loaded by classloaders in this list will not be instrumented. > # This is a useful optimization for runtimes which use classloaders to > # load dynamic classes which the agent would not instrument. > classloader_excludes: > groovy.lang.GroovyClassLoader$InnerLoader, > org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteClassLoader, > com.collaxa.cube.engine.deployment.BPELClassLoader, > org.springframework.data.convert.ClassGeneratingEntityInstantiator$ObjectInstantiatorClassGenerator, > org.mvel2.optimizers.impl.asm.ASMAccessorOptimizer$ContextClassLoader, > gw.internal.gosu.compiler.SingleServingGosuClassLoader, > Copy These lines were added to the default newrelic.yml in Java agent version 3.30.0. If you want to run Java agent version 3.30.0 or higher, ensure you include these lines in your newrelic.yml. Java agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, New Relic will no longer accept data from Java agent versions earlier than 3.6.0, except version 2.21.7. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with New Relic's data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to the New Relic collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 5.0.0 Release notes: Java agent 5.0.0 Self installer: The New Relic Java agent's self-installer has been removed in order to provide a more consistent user experience. To install the Java agent, add the full path to the newrelic.jar to the -javaagent flag in your JVM options. For more information, see the documentation on installing the agent on specific application servers, including Docker, Maven, or Gradle. Deprecated instrumentation: The following instrumentation modules have been moved out of the default Java agent. They are now provided as a separate download. To continue using these modules, just add them to the agent's extensions directory in your New Relic folder or wherever your extensions directory is configured. Deprecated modules include: Akka 2.0 Akka 2.1 Akka-http 1.0 Akka-http 2.0 - 2.4.1 Akka-http 2.4.2 - 2.4.4 Hystrix 1.2 Hystrix 1.3 Play 1: Instrumentation for Play-1.x is not available as an extension. Play 2.0 Play 2.1 Play 2.2 Solr 3.1 - 3.4 Solr 3.5 Solr 3.6 4.12.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.12.0 Deprecated APIs: The custom transport channel API is now deprecated in favor of the distributed tracing API. The skipTransactionTrace attribute on the @Trace annotation is now deprecated. Instead, use the excludeFromTransactionTrace attribute. Deprecated instrumentation: JetS3t: Removed built-in instrumentation for JetS3t. The agent will continue to report external calls made with the JetS3t client. 4.4.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.4.0 Java 6 support removed: You must use 4.3 or earlier. EU data center: Minimum version required for use in EU datacenter. Removed the SSL configuration option: SSL is now always used in communication with New Relic servers. The newrelic.yml ssl configuration and -Dnewrelic.config.ssl system property are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than true will result in logging a warning. Legacy agent 2.21.7 Release notes: Java agent 2.21.7 Java SE 5.0: This is a bugfix release for the legacy Java SE 5.0 version of the agent. Unless you are a Java SE5 user, use the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. This affects: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, OS X Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "This document describes how to pass the -javaagent argument to the JVM for your framework. This installation step ensures the agent is included in your app. For all app servers, ensure you pass the full path to the newrelic.jar file. This document is simply a reference for how to pass the argument. For detailed installation procedures, see Java agent installation. Coldfusion To pass the -javaagent argument on Coldfusion: Start your ColdFusion server and navigate to your ColdFusion admin console. From the left menu, select SERVER SETTINGS > Java and JVM. If using the agent API: Specify the path to newrelic-api.jar in the ColdFusion Class Path field. In the JVM Arguments field, add the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Submit Changes, then restart your ColdFusion server. Geronimo To pass the -javaagent argument on Geronimo, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && geronimo run Copy Glassfish To pass the -javaagent argument on Glassfish: From the Glassfish console, select Application Server > JVM Settings > JVM Options. On the JVM Options page, select Add JVM Option. Add an entry for the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save and restart Glassfish. If Glassfish does not start, the -javaagent argument might not have been set correctly. You can change the server JVM arguments by editing the domain.xml file. Important A bug in Glassfish 2.1 prevents classes on the bootstrap class loader (the New Relic agent) from using the Java logging API. This appears to be fixed in 2.1.1 or higher releases. Grails To pass the -javaagent argument on Grails: Pass with run-app Begin with an unzipped version of Grails. Run this command: grails -noreloading -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar run-app Copy Pass with run-war In your Grails app, open this file with your text editor: grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy Copy Add or edit the JVM arguments line: grails.tomcat.jvmArgs = [\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"] Copy JBoss To pass the -javaagent argument on JBoss: Set with domain mode (6.x EAP and 7.0 AS) Use domain mode for JBoss versions 6.x EAP and 7.0 AS or above: Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Caution A JBoss bug in 7.0.2.Final and 7.1.0.Alpha1 does not allow JVM options to be set in domain.xml. If you encounter this problem, upgrade your JBoss application server. Set with standalone mode (other versions) Use standalone mode for other platforms and versions: Platform Directions Unix / macOS with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS and above At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS or higher In bin/standalone.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_ENDORSED_DIRS=%JBOSS_HOME%\\lib\\endorsed Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Unix / macOS with 6.x or earlier At the bottom of bin/run.conf, add this: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x or earlier In bin/run.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=%RUN_CLASSPATH% Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Jetty To pass the -javaagent argument on Jetty: If you set exec in jetty.sh Edit the JAVA_OPTIONS in your jetty.sh script: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"${JAVA_OPTIONS} -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy If you set exec in start.ini Add the agent path to your start.ini config file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play To pass the -javaagent argument on Play: Play 1.2.4 Append the -javaagent argument when running your Play application: play run your_app_name -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.0 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip dist/*.zip Copy Append the -javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; chmod a+x start; ./start -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.2 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip To enable page load timing, see Manual instrumentation with Play 2.2. Play 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: activator clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy If you use Typesafe Activator with Play 2.4, add this line to your build.sbt: javaOptions ++= Seq(\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\") Copy Resin To pass the -javaagent argument on Resin, add it to the <jvm-args> section in your resin.conf or resin.xml file: <jvm-arg>-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar</jvm-arg> Copy Solr To pass the -javaagent argument on Solr: Standalone Solr 5.x or higher Add the -javaagent property to bin/solr.in.sh: SOLR_OPTS=\"$SOLR_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Standalone Solr 4.x or lower Add the -javaagent before the start.jar: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar start.jar Copy App server Solr When running Solr in an application server, follow the instructions of that application server to add the -javaagent flag. Also ensure that JMX is enabled for the application server. If you don't see data in the APM UI's Solr page, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Solr data. Spring Boot To pass the -javaagent argument on Spring Boot, add it to the command line in which you start your app. Make sure to add it before the -jar argument: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar app.jar Copy Tanuki Wrapper To pass the -javaagent argument on Tanuki Wrapper, add a wrapper option wrapper.conf. In the line below, substitute XXX for an unused number in this file: wrapper.java.additional.XXX=-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip On Linux systems, no quotation marks are required when setting this value. This behavior may vary on other operating systems. Tomcat To pass the -javaagent argument on Tomcat: With setenv.sh Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.sh script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: export CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With setenv.bat Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.bat script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.bat script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: SET \"CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.sh (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. Configure your catalina.sh file to use the New Relic agent using the JAVA_OPTS environment variable: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.bat (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.bat in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. If you use catalina.bat to launch Tomcat, set the JAVA_OPTS variable near the top of the file: SET JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy With Windows Select Start > Apache Tomcat X.Y.Z. > Configure Tomcat > Java. In the Java Options text box, enter the argument. Use forward slashes / for the path separator. For Tomcat 6, add a line break after the -javaagent argument. -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then restart Tomcat. With Apache Commons daemon The version of Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc) included with Tomcat 6 does not support the -javaagent argument used by New Relic. However, a build of the jsvc daemon from the trunk source will support the -javaagent argument via the -X prefix. See the Apache bug tracking the issue. There is a fix in the Apache Commons source repository. For more information: See the Apache source repository documentation. Go directly to the SVN source repository. WebLogic To pass the -javaagent argument on WebLogic: Administration servers on Linux or macOS Edit your startWebLogic.sh file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Administration servers on Windows Edit your startWebLogic.bat file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -javaagent:\"C:\\full\\path\\to\\newrelic.jar\" Copy Managed server instances For administration server instances, follow the Linux/macOS or Windows instructions. You cannot use the administration console to install administration server instances. For managed server instances, use the admin console: From the administration console, navigate to Environments > Servers > (select a server) > Server Start > Arguments. From Arguments, add: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save the page, then restart your server instance. WebSphere To pass the -javaagent argument on WebSphere: From the admin console, select Servers > Application servers > (select a server) > Configuration > Service Infrastructure > Java and Process Management. Select Process Definition > Additional Properties, then select Java Virtual Machine. In the Generic JVM arguments field, add the -javaagent argument for your newrelic.jar file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then select Save. Restart your server. For more information, see the documentation about collecting WebSphere PMI metrics.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Java agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Java agent release notes. These update procedures describe how to replace some of the current contents of your agent root directory, which contains the New Relic Java agent (newrelic.jar), with newly downloaded contents from the New Relic UI. Update to latest version To identify which version of the Java agent you're currently using, run java -jar newrelic.jar -v. Your Java agent version will be printed to your console. Then, to update to the latest Java agent version: Back up the entire Java agent root directory to another location. Rename that directory to NewRelic_Agent#.#.#, where #.#.# is the agent version number. Download the agent. Unzip the new agent download file, then copy newrelic-api.jar and newrelic.jar into the original Java agent root directory. Diff your current newrelic.yml with the newly downloaded newrelic.yml from the zip, and update customized differences as needed. Restart your Java dispatcher. If you experience issues after the Java agent update, restore from the backed-up New Relic agent directory. Update agent config differences If differences between the two versions are unrelated to your app's customizations, align the newrelic.yml you use moving forward with the latest updates to the default newrelic.yml from New Relic. For example, if you diff the default newrelic.yml files for Java agent versions 3.29.0 and 3.30.0, the results printed to the console will be: ➜ diff newrelic_3.29.0.yml newrelic_3.30.0.yml 254a255,265 > # Classes loaded by classloaders in this list will not be instrumented. > # This is a useful optimization for runtimes which use classloaders to > # load dynamic classes which the agent would not instrument. > classloader_excludes: > groovy.lang.GroovyClassLoader$InnerLoader, > org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteClassLoader, > com.collaxa.cube.engine.deployment.BPELClassLoader, > org.springframework.data.convert.ClassGeneratingEntityInstantiator$ObjectInstantiatorClassGenerator, > org.mvel2.optimizers.impl.asm.ASMAccessorOptimizer$ContextClassLoader, > gw.internal.gosu.compiler.SingleServingGosuClassLoader, > Copy These lines were added to the default newrelic.yml in Java agent version 3.30.0. If you want to run Java agent version 3.30.0 or higher, ensure you include these lines in your newrelic.yml. Java agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, New Relic will no longer accept data from Java agent versions earlier than 3.6.0, except version 2.21.7. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with New Relic's data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to the New Relic collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 5.0.0 Release notes: Java agent 5.0.0 Self installer: The New Relic Java agent's self-installer has been removed in order to provide a more consistent user experience. To install the Java agent, add the full path to the newrelic.jar to the -javaagent flag in your JVM options. For more information, see the documentation on installing the agent on specific application servers, including Docker, Maven, or Gradle. Deprecated instrumentation: The following instrumentation modules have been moved out of the default Java agent. They are now provided as a separate download. To continue using these modules, just add them to the agent's extensions directory in your New Relic folder or wherever your extensions directory is configured. Deprecated modules include: Akka 2.0 Akka 2.1 Akka-http 1.0 Akka-http 2.0 - 2.4.1 Akka-http 2.4.2 - 2.4.4 Hystrix 1.2 Hystrix 1.3 Play 1: Instrumentation for Play-1.x is not available as an extension. Play 2.0 Play 2.1 Play 2.2 Solr 3.1 - 3.4 Solr 3.5 Solr 3.6 4.12.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.12.0 Deprecated APIs: The custom transport channel API is now deprecated in favor of the distributed tracing API. The skipTransactionTrace attribute on the @Trace annotation is now deprecated. Instead, use the excludeFromTransactionTrace attribute. Deprecated instrumentation: JetS3t: Removed built-in instrumentation for JetS3t. The agent will continue to report external calls made with the JetS3t client. 4.4.0 Release notes: Java agent 4.4.0 Java 6 support removed: You must use 4.3 or earlier. EU data center: Minimum version required for use in EU datacenter. Removed the SSL configuration option: SSL is now always used in communication with New Relic servers. The newrelic.yml ssl configuration and -Dnewrelic.config.ssl system property are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than true will result in logging a warning. Legacy agent 2.21.7 Release notes: Java agent 2.21.7 Java SE 5.0: This is a bugfix release for the legacy Java SE 5.0 version of the agent. Unless you are a Java SE5 user, use the latest version of the New Relic Java agent. This affects: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, OS X Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50",

Configure the agent Here's how to do a basic setup with agent configuration settings in newrelic.yml. Tip For an advanced installation, you can pass settings with environment variables, Java system properties, or server-side configuration. To understand the precedence of these configuration settings, see Java agent configuration: Config file. The Java agent requires the license_key and app_name settings at startup. All the other settings are optional, and you can review them in Java agent configuration: Config file. Go to the unzipped installation file, and inside the newrelic subdirectory, edit newrelic.yml: Find the line with license_key. Replace ' < %= license_key %>' with your license. For example: license_key: 456n20n1367ov2s174v51nvn789d21s67v26NRAL Copy Find the line with app_name. Replace My Application with a name that helps you identify the application. For example: app_name: Tax Calculator Copy Tip If you need tips about how to name your application, see Name your application. Add optional settings that you want, such as agent logging and distributed tracing (or add them later). Save and close newrelic.yml. 4. Install the agent The Java agent installation involves copying all the unzipped New Relic files into the directory structure of your application server/container. For example, you can create a /opt/newrelic directory, but if you want to put the files elsewhere, make sure of the following: The .jar files in the directory cannot be on the classpath. The .jar files cannot be in directories specified in java.endorsed.dirs. To install the Java agent: In your application server/container directory structure, create a directory for New Relic files (for example, /opt/newrelic). Copy all the New Relic files from your unzipped newrelic directory into your new directory. Make sure that your application server/container includes this option when it starts Java (for tips on how to do this with your tool or framework, see JVM arguments): -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Start or restart your application server/container. Generate some traffic for your app, and then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM Summary page. If nothing appears, follow the troubleshooting procedures. 5. Post-installation tasks If you are using newrelic.yml to make configuration settings, consider the following: We recommend you change the default newrelic.yml file permissions to read/write only for the owner of the application server process. As you would with other important files, be sure newrelic.yml is part of your backup routine. We recommend using New Relic Diagnostics to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy. What's next? Here are some additional topics to consider: For Docker questions, see Install New Relic Java agent for Docker. View your app in New Relic and get comfortable with the user interface. Read the documentation about APM. For example, read about the Summary page, the JVM metrics page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Query your data using NRQL (New Relic Query Language). Learn about setting up custom instrumentation and async instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default.",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session.

Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Java agent installation. Add Java data 1. Before you install Check the following: Make sure you've signed up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Review the compatibility and requirements. Check if your environment requires additional or alternative install steps. 2. Get the agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download the agent From Java agent release notes, download newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory and unzip it. 3. Configure the agent Here's how to do a basic setup with agent configuration settings in newrelic.yml. Tip For an advanced installation, you can pass settings with environment variables, Java system properties, or server-side configuration. To understand the precedence of these configuration settings, see Java agent configuration: Config file. The Java agent requires the license_key and app_name settings at startup. All the other settings are optional, and you can review them in Java agent configuration: Config file. Go to the unzipped installation file, and inside the newrelic subdirectory, edit newrelic.yml: Find the line with license_key. Replace ' < %= license_key %>' with your license. For example: license_key: 456n20n1367ov2s174v51nvn789d21s67v26NRAL Copy Find the line with app_name. Replace My Application with a name that helps you identify the application. For example: app_name: Tax Calculator Copy Tip If you need tips about how to name your application, see Name your application. Add optional settings that you want, such as agent logging and distributed tracing (or add them later). Save and close newrelic.yml. 4. Install the agent The Java agent installation involves copying all the unzipped New Relic files into the directory structure of your application server/container. For example, you can create a /opt/newrelic directory, but if you want to put the files elsewhere, make sure of the following: The .jar files in the directory cannot be on the classpath. The .jar files cannot be in directories specified in java.endorsed.dirs. To install the Java agent: In your application server/container directory structure, create a directory for New Relic files (for example, /opt/newrelic). Copy all the New Relic files from your unzipped newrelic directory into your new directory. Make sure that your application server/container includes this option when it starts Java (for tips on how to do this with your tool or framework, see JVM arguments): -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Start or restart your application server/container. Generate some traffic for your app, and then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM Summary page. If nothing appears, follow the troubleshooting procedures. 5. Post-installation tasks If you are using newrelic.yml to make configuration settings, consider the following: We recommend you change the default newrelic.yml file permissions to read/write only for the owner of the application server process. As you would with other important files, be sure newrelic.yml is part of your backup routine. We recommend using New Relic Diagnostics to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy. What's next? Here are some additional topics to consider: For Docker questions, see Install New Relic Java agent for Docker. View your app in New Relic and get comfortable with the user interface. Read the documentation about APM. For example, read about the Summary page, the JVM metrics page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Query your data using NRQL (New Relic Query Language). Learn about setting up custom instrumentation and async instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default.",

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI From one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then search for \"Java\". Select the Java app monitoring option and complete the process. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report data to your New Relic account. To copy your license key: Go to the API keys UI and get a license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.

      "body": "This document describes how to pass the -javaagent argument to the JVM for your framework. This installation step ensures the agent is included in your app. For all app servers, ensure you pass the full path to the newrelic.jar file. This document is simply a reference for how to pass the argument. For detailed installation procedures, see Java agent installation. Coldfusion To pass the -javaagent argument on Coldfusion: Start your ColdFusion server and navigate to your ColdFusion admin console. From the left menu, select SERVER SETTINGS > Java and JVM. If using the agent API: Specify the path to newrelic-api.jar in the ColdFusion Class Path field. In the JVM Arguments field, add the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Submit Changes, then restart your ColdFusion server. Geronimo To pass the -javaagent argument on Geronimo, refer to the New Relic agent jar in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable when running the startup command: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" && geronimo run Copy Glassfish To pass the -javaagent argument on Glassfish: From the Glassfish console, select Application Server > JVM Settings > JVM Options. On the JVM Options page, select Add JVM Option. Add an entry for the -javaagent argument: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Save and restart Glassfish. If Glassfish does not start, the -javaagent argument might not have been set correctly. You can change the server JVM arguments by editing the domain.xml file. Important A bug in Glassfish 2.1 prevents classes on the bootstrap class loader (the New Relic agent) from using the Java logging API. This appears to be fixed in 2.1.1 or higher releases. Grails To pass the -javaagent argument on Grails: Pass with run-app Begin with an unzipped version of Grails. Run this command: grails -noreloading -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar run-app Copy Pass with run-war In your Grails app, open this file with your text editor: grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy Copy Add or edit the JVM arguments line: grails.tomcat.jvmArgs = [\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"] Copy JBoss To pass the -javaagent argument on JBoss: Set with domain mode (6.x EAP and 7.0 AS) Use domain mode for JBoss versions 6.x EAP and 7.0 AS or above: Edit the JVM properties for your server group, located in: domain/configuration/domain.xml Copy Modify the properties to include the -javaagent argument: <server-group name=\"main-server-group\" profile=\"full\"> <jvm name=\"default\"> <jvm-options> <option value=\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\"/> </jvm-options> </jvm> ... </server-group> Copy Caution A JBoss bug in 7.0.2.Final and 7.1.0.Alpha1 does not allow JVM options to be set in domain.xml. If you encounter this problem, upgrade your JBoss application server. Set with standalone mode (other versions) Use standalone mode for other platforms and versions: Platform Directions Unix / macOS with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS and above At the bottom of bin/standalone.conf, add: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x EAP or 7.0.x AS or higher In bin/standalone.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_ENDORSED_DIRS=%JBOSS_HOME%\\lib\\endorsed Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Unix / macOS with 6.x or earlier At the bottom of bin/run.conf, add this: JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Windows with 6.x or earlier In bin/run.bat, before the line: set JBOSS_CLASSPATH=%RUN_CLASSPATH% Copy Add: set \"JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:C:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar %JAVA_OPTS%\" Copy Jetty To pass the -javaagent argument on Jetty: If you set exec in jetty.sh Edit the JAVA_OPTIONS in your jetty.sh script: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"${JAVA_OPTIONS} -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy If you set exec in start.ini Add the agent path to your start.ini config file: -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play To pass the -javaagent argument on Play: Play 1.2.4 Append the -javaagent argument when running your Play application: play run your_app_name -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.0 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip dist/*.zip Copy Append the -javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; chmod a+x start; ./start -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Play 2.2 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: play clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip To enable page load timing, see Manual instrumentation with Play 2.2. Play 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 Begin with an unzipped distribution containing the start script: activator clean dist && unzip target/directory/universal/*.zip Copy Append the -J-javaagent argument when starting your Play app: cd unzipped/folder; ./bin/scriptname -J-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy If you use Typesafe Activator with Play 2.4, add this line to your build.sbt: javaOptions ++= Seq(\"-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\") Copy Resin To pass the -javaagent argument on Resin, add it to the <jvm-args> section in your resin.conf or resin.xml file: <jvm-arg>-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar</jvm-arg> Copy Solr To pass the -javaagent argument on Solr: Standalone Solr 5.x or higher Add the -javaagent property to bin/solr.in.sh: SOLR_OPTS=\"$SOLR_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Standalone Solr 4.x or lower Add the -javaagent before the start.jar: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar start.jar Copy App server Solr When running Solr in an application server, follow the instructions of that application server to add the -javaagent flag. Also ensure that JMX is enabled for the application server. If you don't see data in the APM UI's Solr page, follow the troubleshooting procedures for Solr data. Spring Boot To pass the -javaagent argument on Spring Boot, add it to the command line in which you start your app. Make sure to add it before the -jar argument: java -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar -jar app.jar Copy Tanuki Wrapper To pass the -javaagent argument on Tanuki Wrapper, add a wrapper option wrapper.conf. In the line below, substitute XXX for an unused number in this file: wrapper.java.additional.XXX=-javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Tip On Linux systems, no quotation marks are required when setting this value. This behavior may vary on other operating systems. Tomcat To pass the -javaagent argument on Tomcat: With setenv.sh Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.sh script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: export CATALINA_OPTS=\"$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With setenv.bat Create a CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.bat script if one doesn't already exist. Configure your setenv.bat script to use the New Relic agent using the CATALINA_OPTS environment variable: SET \"CATALINA_OPTS=%CATALINA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.sh (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. Configure your catalina.sh file to use the New Relic agent using the JAVA_OPTS environment variable: export JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy With catalina.bat (NOT RECOMMENDED) Tip We recommend that you do not set any variables in this script. Instead put them into a script setenv.bat in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate. If you use catalina.bat to launch Tomcat, set the JAVA_OPTS variable near the top of the file: SET JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy With Windows Select Start > Apache Tomcat X.Y.Z. > Configure Tomcat > Java. In the Java Options text box, enter the argument. Use forward slashes / for the path separator. For Tomcat 6, add a line break after the -javaagent argument. -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar Copy Select Apply, then restart Tomcat. With Apache Commons daemon The version of Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc) included with Tomcat 6 does not support the -javaagent argument used by New Relic. However, a build of the jsvc daemon from the trunk source will support the -javaagent argument via the -X prefix. See the Apache bug tracking the issue. There is a fix in the Apache Commons source repository. For more information: See the Apache source repository documentation. Go directly to the SVN source repository. WebLogic To pass the -javaagent argument on WebLogic: Administration servers on Linux or macOS Edit your startWebLogic.sh file, located in the domain's bin directory. Near the beginning of the file, add: export JAVA_OPTIONS=\"$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:/full/path/to/newrelic.jar\" Copy Administration servers on Windows Edit your startWebLogic.bat file, located in the domain's bin directory.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter(). Find the appropriate methods based on the framework you are using: JSP manual instrumentation Insert the header as close to the top of <head> tag as possible but after the meta tags.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter(). Find the appropriate methods based on the framework you are using: JSP manual instrumentation Insert the header as close to the top of <head> tag as possible but after the meta tags.

      "body": "The Java agent is a fully-featured library that automatically collects data from many popular servers, frameworks, libraries, and datastores (for a full list, see Compatibility and requirements). It also has a significant feature set. However, there are always additional requests for functionality and instrumentation of new libraries. The Java agent provides extension modules for this purpose. Extension modules fall into three general categories: Incubator instrumentation modules: Experimental new support to collect data from specific libraries Archived instrumentation modules: Instrumentation for libraries that the original company or author no longer maintains or updates. Feature extension modules: Code that adds new behavior to the agent, independent of any specific library. If your library isn't covered by the automatic instrumentation or by an instrumentation module, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation. Tip If you have feedback, questions, or problems with this instrumentation, create a post in New Relic's Explorers Hub, and tag your post with java_incubator. Install extension modules We recommend updating to the latest Java agent version before installing an extension module. To install an extension module: Download the appropriate .jar file from module lists below. Locate the directory that contains your newrelic.jar and newrelic.yml files. In that directory, create a sub-directory named extensions (if there is not already one there). Copy the .jar extension module you downloaded into the extensions directory. For Feature extension modules, update your newrelic.yml with feature-specific configuration. Restart your server. Send some traffic to the server or host that will exercise the feature or instrumentation. Tip Java agent extension modules are subject to the New Relic Java agent licenses, which are included in each module jar's LICENSE file. Feature extension modules Extension modules are additional libraries that add commonly-requested functionality. To use the an extension module, download it and put it in the Extensions Directory. Class Histogram Download link Download the module The Class Histogram extension runs jmap periodically and generates ClassHistogramRowEvent and ClassHistogramStatsEvent data that you can query and chart. Querying this data can be useful when troubleshooting memory leaks as you can see the values over time. You configure the Class Histogram extension the same way you configure the Java agent: using environment variables, system properties, or newrelic.yml. Here are available properties, with defaults: extensions: class_histogram: enabled: true # true is the default if the extension is present classes_per_histogram: 50 # 50 is the default, and memory leak issues are usually in the highest 50 classes by bytes jmap_path: /your/jdk/bin # The folder where the jmap binary lives. The default is $JAVA_HOME/bin. delay_between_calls_seconds: 60 # Length of the delay between executions to avoid frequent pauses Copy Incubator instrumentation modules Incubator modules are experimental instrumentation, which we may build into the agent's automatic instrumentation in the future. These are the incubator modules that are currently available: Apache Camel 2.12 Download link Download the module This instrumentation module intercepts the following: org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet.resolve Copy To name the transaction so that web transactions have a finer grained name than the Camel servlet name, it uses this: org.apache.camel.component.http.HttpConsumer.getPath() Copy To view the bytecode, use this terminal command: javap -verbose -cp camel-2.12-FILENAME.jar org.apache.camel.component.http.CamelServlet Copy C3P0 database connection pools Download link Download the module Java agent version 3.12.0 or higher This instrumentation module samples C3P0 connection pools and reports busy and idle counts in metrics that start with this: Custom/Database Connection/C3P0/METRIC_NAME Copy You can view the metrics with the metric explorer.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring gives you visibility into how your users are interacting with your Java application by using a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. To install the browser agent via the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. For example, you can: Enable an APM-monitored app. Enable with the copy/paste method. Enable by using the REST API. You can also manually instrument your webpages by using the Java agent API, as explained in this document. Use Java agent API If your framework does not allow you to enable browser monitoring from our UI, with the copy/paste method, or by using our REST API, you can manually instrument monitoring for your webpages. To do this, use our Java agent API. Make sure you are using the latest Java agent version. Disable auto-instrumentation. Disable auto-instrumentation on all pages Set the auto_instrument flag under browser_monitoring to false in your newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: false Copy Restart your application. Flush the app server's work cache. Flushing the work cache forces the app server to recompile JSPs, which is when auto-instrumentation occurs. Disable auto-instrumentation only on specific pages Use the disabled_auto_pages flag under the browser_monitoring stanza. For example, to disable auto-instrumentation on testpage_1.jsp and testpage_2.jsp, use the following: browser_monitoring: disabled_auto_pages: /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_1.jsp, /WEB-INF/jsp/testpage_2.jsp Copy Access the Java agent API class by adding newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. Add the appropriate method to start time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(). Add the appropriate method to stop time tracking, for example: com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingFooter().

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent automatically collects data from Kafka's Java clients library. Because Kafka is a high-performance messaging system that generates a lot of data, you can customize the agent for your app's specific throughput and use cases. This document explains how to collect and view three types of Kafka data: Kafka metrics Kafka events Kafka distributed traces Kafka instrumentation is available in Java agent versions 4.12.0 or higher. For supported Kafka client versions, see Java compatibility and requirements. Tip For our Kafka integration, see Kafka monitoring integration. View Kafka metrics After installation, the agent automatically reports rich Kafka metrics with information about messaging rates, latency, lag, and more. The Java agent collects all Kafka consumer and producer metrics (but not connect or stream metrics). To view these metrics, create a custom dashboard: Go to the New Relic metric explorer. Use the metric explorer to locate your metrics. You can find Kafka metrics in this metric folder: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/KafkaMetricName Copy For example, the request-rate metric is located at: MessageBroker/Kafka/Internal/consumer-metrics/request-rate Copy Tip For a full list of Kafka consumer and producer metrics, see the Kafka documentation. Add the metrics you want to monitor to a dashboard by clicking Add to dashboard. Enable Kafka event collection You can configure the agent to collect event data instead of metric timeslice data (for the difference between metric timeslice and event data, see data collection). This allows you to use NRQL to filter and facet the default Kafka metrics. When enabled, the agent collects one Kafka event every 30 seconds. This event contains all of the the data from Kafka consumer and produce metrics captured since the previous event. Important The agent records up to 2000 events per harvest cycle, though you can change this value with max_samples_stored. Kafka event data is included in this pool. If you use the recordCustomEvent() API call to send custom events to New Relic and you send more than 2000 events, the agent will discard some Kafka or custom events. To enable Kafka event collection: Add the kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled element to your newrelic.yml config file: kafka.metrics.as_events.enabled: true Copy Restart your JVM. Use the event explorer to view your Kafka events, located in the KafkaMetrics event type. Or, use NRQL to query your events directly. For example: SELECT average('producer-metrics.record-send-rate') from KafkaMetrics SINCE 30 minutes ago timeseries Copy Enable Kafka distributed traces The Java agent can also collect distributed traces from Kafka clients. Enabling traces doesn't affect the agent's normal operations: it will still report metric or event data from Kafka. Impacts and requirements to consider before enabling: The instrumentation adds a 150 to 200 byte payload to message headers. If your Kafka messages are very small, traces can add significant processing and storage overhead. This additional payload size could cause Kafka to drop messages if they exceed your Kafka messaging size limit. For this reason, we recommend testing out Kafka distributed traces in a dev environment before enabling them in production. Distributed tracing is only available for Kafka client versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the Transition guide before enabling. To propagate W3C trace context via Kafka message headers, see the distributed tracing API usage guide for details on APIs that were released in Java agent 6.4.0. Note that adding additional headers to Kafka messages will further increase the payload size. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent trace APIs with Kafka. The complete process of enabling this is below but at a high level it involves these basic steps: 1) enable tracing via the agent config, and 2) calling the Java agent API to instrument transactions on both the producer and consumer side. To collect distributed traces from Kafka: 1. Enable distributed tracing in the config file If you have not enabled distributed tracing for your app before, read the distributed tracing transition guide before you enable it. To enable Kafka distributed tracings, enable two settings in your newrelic.yml config file: Set the distributed_tracing element to true: distributed_tracing: enabled: true Copy Enable the Kafka-specific distributed tracing features by adding the following to your config file: class_transformer: com.newrelic.instrumentation.kafka-clients-spans-0.11.0.0: enabled: true Copy 2. Instrument the Kafka producer To instrument your Kafka producer, you'll need to start a transaction before any calls to Producer.send(ProducerRecord<K, V> record). To do this, add the Java agent @Trace(dispatcher = true) annotation to the method. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) public static void createAndSend(KafkaProducer<String, String> producer){ ProducerRecord<String, String> data = new ProducerRecord<String, String>(\"topic\", \"key\", \"value\"); producer.send(data); } Copy 3. Instrument the Kafka consumer To instrument your Kafka consumer, you'll need to start a transaction when the message is being processed. The agent stores the distributed tracing payload header under the newrelic key or under the W3C's traceparent and tracestate keys. Retrieve the header, then call the New Relic transaction API to accept the payload. For example: @Trace(dispatcher = true) private static void processMessage(ConsumerRecord<String, String> rec) { // create a distributed trace headers map Headers dtHeaders = ConcurrentHashMapHeaders.build(HeaderType.MESSAGE); // Iterate through each record header and insert the trace headers into the dtHeaders map for (Header header : rec.headers()) { String headerValue = new String(header.value(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // using the newrelic key if (header.key().equals(\"newrelic\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"newrelic\", headerValue); } // or using the W3C keys if (header.key().equals(\"traceparent\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"traceparent\", headerValue); } if (header.key().equals(\"tracestate\")) { dtHeaders.addHeader(\"tracestate\", headerValue); } } // Accept distributed tracing headers to link this request to the originating request NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType.Kafka, dtHeaders); } Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

Log in to your Heroku account. From the APM Add-On Page, select a subscription plan. Select Install New Relic APM, and then select your target app from the dropdown. Installing the add-on automatically creates a New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. 2. Provide the path to the jar file After you enable the New Relic agent add-on, pass the javaagent flag to the java process and provide the path to the jar file by editing your Procfile. Deploy to Heroku If you deploy to Heroku, the location of the jar file for both Maven and manual configuration is in the app's root folder in a directory called newrelic. Example: web: java -javaagent:/app/newrelic/newrelic.jar -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy Deploy locally If you deploy locally, your jar file might be in a different directory. If it is, replace PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR with the path to the jar file in your local directory. Example: web: java -javaagent:PATH/TO/NEWRELIC.JAR -jar target/HELLOWORLD.jar Copy 3. Configure your Heroku environment for New Relic After you provide the path to the jar file, configure your Heroku environment for New Relic, depending on your platform: Maven configuration Give your app a meaningful name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"APP_NAME\" Copy Add your New Relic license key: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"LICENSE_KEY\" Copy In your pom.xml, add the newrelic-agent dependency, substituting X.Y.Z with the latest Java agent version. Recommended: To ensure proper formatting is applied and contents do not contain sensitive information, format the syntax using http://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer. <dependency> <groupId>com.newrelic.agent.java</groupId> <artifactId>newrelic-java</artifactId> <version>X.Y.Z</version> <scope>provided</scope> <type>zip</type> </dependency> Copy In the <build> element of pom.xml, customize the build so it downloads the agent: <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.2</version> <executions> <execution> <id>unpack-newrelic</id> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>unpack-dependencies</goal> </goals> <configuration> <includeGroupIds>com.newrelic.agent.java</includeGroupIds> <includeArtifactIds>newrelic-java</includeArtifactIds> <overWriteReleases>false</overWriteReleases> <overWriteSnapshots>false</overWriteSnapshots> <overWriteIfNewer>true</overWriteIfNewer> <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}</outputDirectory> <destFileName>newrelic</destFileName> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> Copy Manual configuration Log in to dashboard.heroku.com.

The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above, we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. Some vendors have backported JFR to their Java 8 binaries. For instance, OpenJDK backported JFR on version 8u262. The JFR daemon is compatible with those Java versions. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory. View your data To view your data, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > More Views > Realtime Profiling Java. Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated. JVM details The details panel for each JVM provides several critical views: How resources are allocated within a process How garbage collection affects performance How to track garbage collection with logs How CPU is used one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM. Identify resource intensive code paths using flamegraphs Important The flamegraph feature is only compatible with the New Relic Java agent JFR service usage scenario. Use flamegraphs to identify the Java classes and methods that are most frequently executed in your application code. By using flamegraphs to optimize the hot spots in your code you can reduce resource consumption and increase your application’s overall performance. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java > (select JVM): You can see details for each JVM, including flamegraphs.",

To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the New Relic APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MS SQL Server In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mssql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MS SQL server is running. 127.0.0.1 M/I PORT Port on which MS SQL server is listening. Note: Port is only required when INSTANCE is not specified. 1433 M/I INSTANCE The MS SQL Server Instance to connect to. Note: Only required when PORT is not specified. Do not use both. N/A M/I USERNAME Username for accessing the MS SQL server. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A M/I EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A M/I ENABLE_SSL Use SSL to connect to the MS SQL Server. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE if set to true, server certificate is NOT verified for SSL. false M/I CERTIFICATE_LOCATION Location of the SSL Certificate. N/A M/I TIMEOUT Timeout for queries, in seconds. Set 0 for no timeout. 30 M/I ENABLE_BUFFER_METRICS Enable collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. true M ENABLE_DATABASE_RESERVE_METRICS Enable collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. true M CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query to collect custom metrics. See example below. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG YAML configuration with one or more SQL queries to collect custom metrics. See example below. false M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost. It uses default connection on port 1433: integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mssql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 15 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mssql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mssql Copy Multi Instance connection This configuration monitors 2 instances on the same SQL Server (mssql_instance1 and mssql_instance1). When connecting directly to an Instance you will need to remove the PORT setting. The SQL Browser service also needs to be running on the server: integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: HOSTNAME: localhost USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password INSTANCE: mssql_instance1 interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mssql - name: nri-mssql env: HOSTNAME: localhost USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password INSTANCE: mssql_instance2 interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mssql Copy Metrics-only connecting over SSL Use to connect to MS SQL using SSL without validation of the certificate: integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Buffer Pool and Partition Reserve metrics optimization If the integration causes some overhead on your SQL server, disabling Buffer Pool and Database Partition Reserve metrics can help to optimize the integration's performance. In this example we also increased the sampling interval to 30 seconds to reduce the sampling frequency: integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql_user PASSWORD: mssql_password ENABLE_BUFFER_METRICS: false ENABLE_DATABASE_RESERVE_METRICS: false interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mssql Copy Custom Query You can use custom a custom query to collect additional metrics. Custom metrics will be added to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event sample. Note: If you need to use multiple custom queries, remove this setting and use CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG instead. integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mssql_host1 PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql1_user PASSWORD: mssql1_password CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Multiple Custom Queries If you need multiple custom SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and reference that file on your configuration. For more examples of custom queries, check our sample file on github. NOTE: CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG is only enabled if CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY is not present. integrations: - name: nri-mssql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mssql_host1 PORT: 1433 USERNAME: mssql1_user PASSWORD: mssql1_password CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: 'C:\\path\\to\\mssql-custom-query.yml' interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Microsoft SQL Server integration links. Microsoft SQL Server data is attached to the following event types: MssqlDatabaseSample MssqlInstanceSample MssqlWaitSample MssqlCustomQuerySample (if you running custom queries) For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Inventory data The Microsoft SQL Server integration captures the configuration parameters and current settings of the Microsoft SQL Server environment. It collects the results of the sp_configure stored procedure, as well as current running configuration settings from the sys.configurations table. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/mssql source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Using the Data retention page, review and manage how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). Keep data for shorter periods to protect sensitive information or for longer periods to notice trends over time. At a glance, get the sources of data that you’re storing, when they were last updated, and the length the data is stored. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data's source and namespace classifications in New Relic. From the Data retention page, which shows the source of data, you can click Edit settings to adjust the data retention for each source. Important This doc applies to organizations on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you have different data retention rules. See Original data retention. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. Retention periods The following table shows the default retention settings for our New Relic One pricing plan. To adjust retention settings, you must be on a Pro or Enterprise tier. Source Event namespace Days retained APM APM 8 APM APM errors 8 Browser Browser 8 Browser Browser events 8 Browser Browser JS errors 8 Browser Browser page view timing 8 Custom events Custom events 30 Serverless Lambda 8 Serverless Lambda custom 8 Serverless Lambda spans 8 Logs Log 30 Infrastructure Infrastructure processes 8 Infrastructure Infrastructure integrations 395 (13 months) Mobile Mobile crash event trails (breadcrumb) 8 Mobile Mobile exception 8 Mobile Mobile general 8 Mobile Mobile error 8 Mobile Mobile crash 90 Mobile Mobile session 90 Synthetics Synthetics data 395 (13 months) Traces Traces 8 Adjust retention values You can adjust your retention periods to better support your data needs. For example, you might reduce your contracted retention values to optimize query performance. Conversely, you might increase retention for some data types to support more granular analysis over longer periods of time, or to meet data compliance requirements. The ability to edit data retention periods requires a specific edition of New Relic. Original pricing plan users must have Insights Pro. New Relic One pricing plan users have these edition considerations: Standard edition: your data retention is fixed, and falls between 8 and 395 days (about 13 months) of retention, depending on which capabilities of the New Relic platform you’re using. The prescribed retention levels ensure that you can explore your data and experience the value of New Relic. If you need to raise some of the retention limits for your particular business needs, you can purchase additional retention. Pro or Enterprise: If after you finalize your contracted retention you realize you need to make changes, you can adjust your telemetry data retention settings yourself. User roles and retention In order to edit retention, users need these roles: Users on New Relic One user model: the Billing user role Users on the original user model: the Owner or Data retention manager add-on role Reduce retention values When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear. That data might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly removing data. That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration. Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce New Relic’s data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges. Copy retention values If you have permission to edit retention settings, you can also copy retention values from one child account to other child accounts under the same parent account. To do this, from within a child account, select the Copy settings to other accounts link, and then select the child accounts you want to apply the retention values to. Select the child accounts you want to copy retention values to. Data deletion Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention period ends. If you need to delete data, contact your New Relic representative. Manage retention via API You can change your retention settings with NerdGraph as well as the UI. For the following examples, provide any necessary information, and run the code in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a child account, that child account will adopt the current retention value of its parent account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a parent account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing child account rules to others You can specify a child account to be the template or source account, and have other destination child accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source child account. Note: all child accounts must be within the same parent account. To copy an existing set of retentions: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account IDs that were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account. Metric data rollup Metric timeslice data is generated by APM (both custom metrics and default metrics), mobile, and browser agents. Metric timeslice data is aggregated like this: first to 1-minute rollups retained for 8 days then aggregated to 1-hour roll-ups for 90 days Key metric data is stored indefinitely. We meter on the size of the initial 1-minute rollup, not on any of the subsequent rollups. Read on to learn the key metrics by product. Key metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile Here are the key metrics that are stored indefinitely. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Raw metric data Raw metric data is handled a little differently when it comes from APM, Prometheus remote-write API, metrics functionality of the Telemetry SDK, and integrations built on the Telemetry SDK. Raw sub-minute metric data is stored for 30 days. Beyond 30 days, 1-minute resolution roll-up events are created and retained for 13 months. Like with metric timeslice data, we meter and bill on the size of the raw ingest, not the subsequent rollups. Metric retention periods are not editable. Account inheritance The data retention settings of a parent account are inherited by its children accounts. In this context, an organization's first account is treated as the parent account, and other accounts added to the organization inherit the settings in that account. You also have the option to override those settings and set account-specific data retention settings. Original pricing plan differences If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you have different data retention rules. See Original data retention.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated.

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated.

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the New Relic APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "New Relic collects and reports information on web transactions and non-web transactions, such as background tasks. New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the New Relic APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, docs category (index) views, and more. For succinct instructions, see Procedures, but it is highly recommended you understand the general concepts of how the docs site structure works if you will be doing larger docs site projects. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Nav files: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the nav folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like this one). Folder: We sometimes use \"folders\" to refer to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content section). This is a way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or subcategory: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to the various levels of docs site categories. For example, this view shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does this higher level category view. Index: In this context, an \"index\" is sometimes used to refer to a view of a certain category of docs (like this one). \"Index\" and \"category\" can be used a bit interchangably, but the gist is that the \"index\" term refers to a docs category being displayed in a page load. (Note that this is a different, more general use of the term than the index.mdx files that are used to build landing pages.) Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual docs folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure that we display (e.g., the structure shown in the sidebar and category views like this one). The displayed structure of the docs site is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the displayed site structure, which is used for the sidebar and category views, without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely parallel and matching. Because these two things are so separate, it means we have some fairly complex behind-the-scenes logic to get them to work together. And this means that there can be fairly unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes, and this means that you will have to add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL, so that means you would have to add a redirect to that doc for its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls these things: The docs structure (the various levels of docs) for that category of docs. The category headers, set by title (e.g., \"On-host integrations list\") and path (e.g., \"/docs/integrations/on-host-integrations\"). The doc information, set by title (e.g., \"NGINX integration\") and path (the doc's URL). A category and a doc in a nav file have the same elements: a title and a `path. What separates a category from a doc is that: A category contains docs in the level below it. If a category has a path (which isn't required but should be present for most docs), the path points to a content docs folder that has at least one doc in it. For more on nav file format, see Nav file format Where is the docs site structure exposed? The structure set in the nav files is exposed in two places: The left sidebar of a doc that shows the structure of that category. When a category header in the sidebar is clicked, it shows a view of that docs site category. Doc category views, also sometimes called index views: for example, this view, which shows a particular section of docs. What determines a doc's sidebar? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure governed by the nav files is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL in the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. If it finds that doc in more than one nav file, it attempts to find the right nav file by choosing the nav that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with a relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. For an example of a doc that is placed in two different nav files, in this category view click the Manage data doc and see how, when it loads, it displays the sidebar for the nav file that better matches its URL. When you click a sidebar category, what determines how that category view displays? When you click on a docs category header in the sidebar and a docs category view loads (like this one), what governs what is displayed there? Here is how this process works: A category header in the sidebar has an associated URL, which is set in the nav file. In the example nav file snippet below, the Get started category view has a path set to /docs/apis/intro-apis. This is what governs the sidebar heading title of \"Get started\" and tells it the URL to use. - title: APIs path: /docs/apis pages: - title: Get started path: /docs/apis/intro-apis pages: - title: New Relic APIs path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis - title: API keys path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys Copy If the associated folder of that path has an index mdx file (representing a landing page, like this one), the docs site displays that landing page. If there is no landing page, we check to see if that path matches an actual folder that has at least one mdx file. In other words, if we instead put in a completely arbitrary URL path for a category path, like docs/random-category/random-category-2, it would not work. It requires an existing folder with at least one doc in there. Other aspects to consider: Note that a category doesn't need a path link in the nav file; that is just what tells it to create a link and a URL for that view. If a category in a nav file lacks a path, it won't have a link or associated URL for it (for an example, see the \"New Relic University\" category in this section). Having a category without an associated link/URL can be an acceptable choice if you are creating a category of docs that don't reside in that section and you simply want to give a helpful category view in the sidebar. Note that every URL based on actual folder structure can create a theoretical URL. For example, here's a URL based on an actual folder containing one doc. But because there is no path in a nav file corresponding to that URL, it doesn't display anything. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc or the category view. Do not use trailing slashes. For docs categories in the nav file, the path is required to create an index view. Without the path, a docs category won't be clickable as a link and won't display a view of those docs. Learn more about index views. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide rootNav: false Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. It may help you to review the terms we use before starting a procedure. Procedures include: Add a new category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create a \"dummy\" category for docs that don’t live in that area Make a category heading clickable Troubleshoot messed up category views Add a new category We'll explain two procedures: adding a subcategory of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file. Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare, and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the structure of existing nav files as a template. For more on structure, see nav format. Tip You need at least one level of nesting inside the nav file. Without that, doc titles in the auto-generated category views will render as H2 headings. For example, src/content/level-one/level-two/doc will work, but src/content/level-one/doc will produce strange formatting. If you don't want your new nav to appear on the main landing page, add rootNav: false to your .yml file. (For an example of this, see src/nav/style-guide.yml.) Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title and path. If you're adding a path for that category (recommended), it must use the URL of an existing folder with at least one mdx file in it. Add the docs you want in that section. Ensure your new content matches the indenting of the surrounding nav file. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined If a category view isn't clickable, see Make category view clickable. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in one or more nav files. To do this: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the indenting based on the surrounding nav file content or other nav files. Add doc in multiple sidebar locations To add a doc in more than one sidebar location, simply add that doc (its title and path) wherever you want it to be in the nav file. For more on how the sidebar is determined for docs in multiple nav files, see Sidebar. You can add a doc URL in multiple nav file locations. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file You would move a doc in the nav file when you want to change its location in the displayed docs site structure (i.e., the sidebar and docs category views). To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure that new content is aligned properly with the surrounding nav file content. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move docs between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming very different, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create issues with category view displays or sidebar actions. Too much divergence can make finding and editing docs harder, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL. Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about ways to programmatically add redirects. Remove the trailing slash. Move the doc to the new folder. Update nav files with the new URL. This is easily overlooked but having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. If you are moving an entire folder or multiple folders to another folder, docs and all: Simply move these folders using your preferred method (e.g., using drag and drop) to the new location. Next, because that move changes all the URLs of the docs and categories, you'll need to add redirects: For adding redirects for docs, see the procedures for moving a doc between folders. For category redirects: For the section of the nav file affected by your folder editing, gather all the category URLs (path fields) that relate to the moved or deleted folders. We don't need to redirect all folder-related URL paths: we only need to redirect the nav file paths because those represent the paths that we actually link to in the docs (in other words: we aren't using folder-based URLs if they don't have a nav file path). Add those category path URLs as redirects in specific docs or, if that won't work, in the taxonomy-redirects file. We should aim to add category redirects in specific docs and the reason for this is that the taxonomy-redirects file is hard to use and because it's a better customer experience to land on a doc versus a category if possible. In most cases, you'll be able to find a fitting doc to redirect to but if only a category view makes sense, use the taxonomy redirects file. For larger projects, this can be tough work, so you'll want to check out the build and make sure all the sidebar links and category headers are working as expected. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: either moving or deleting the docs in those folders first, gathering the affected category path URLs and adding them as redirects, adn then deleting the empty folders. Create a \"dummy\" sub-category of docs that don't live in that category Sometimes you want to create a category of docs that is there to help expose a related doc or set of docs. For example, in this view, we have added a category for 'New Relic University' even though that's not a doc that lives in that section; in this case, it's not even a doc on our site. In the example above, this 'New Relic University' category header is in regular text and not a link, and that's because it doesn't have a path set for it in the nav file. This also means that in the sidebar, this category header is not a clickable link and simply functions as a collapser/expander. This is acceptable if you don't mind it but below we explain how you can get a clickable category if you need it. To create a so-called \"dummy\" category: Add the category structure you want in the nav file. If you're okay not having a clickable category header, your new category doesn't require a path. If you want a clickable category header, you will need to use or create a folder that matches the new category path and that has at least one mdx file in it (details). In the nav file, add the title and path information for the docs you want in that new category. Test your new category to ensure it is working correctly. Make a sidebar category heading clickable If there's a sidebar category that's only acting as an expander/collapser and doesn't have a link, that's because it either a) doesn't have a path set in the nav file, or b) that path goes to a folder that doesn't have a doc in it. For more on this, see the instructions regarding clickable headers in the \"dummy\" category section. Troubleshoot category views not working correctly If a docs category view is not working correctly, review how category views are formed. If this does happen, get another opinion from another tech writer to make sure you're not missing something, as we should rarely have problems. One reason that a category view might not work is specifically for path URLs that are also landing pages. In this case, if that path is used in more than one location in the same nav file, the docs site can be confused about which category view to use. We may fix this with a coding fix but in meantime: consider pointing to other URLs and not that path, so that there's only one use of that path per nav file.",

To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate.

      "body": "New Relic connects metrics to individual applications using your license key and the primary application name. You can change the app's name in your config file, or assign an alias to the app to change how it appears in the New Relic UI. Important If you do not specify the app name in your New Relic configuration file, most New Relic agents provide a generic application name by default. To ensure all aggregated data for the same app is reported accurately, make sure you give each app a descriptive name. Changing the name vs. the alias You can assign a new app name or change the app alias. These have two different effects: Term How to change it Effect Name Assign the name in your config file Changing the app name in the agent's configuration file will cause the application to report to a new heading in the New Relic user interface, with a total discontinuity of data. This is useful, for example, if you want to start over and report new data. If no other agents are reporting to the old app name, the old app name will appear gray and can be deleted. Alias Change the alias in the APM Settings UI Creating an alias for the app name only changes how the app name appears in the New Relic UI. Changing the alias does not affect how data is reported. It simply helps you keep track of your data with a useful alias. Give each app a descriptive name By default, most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as My Application or PHP Application, for each app that is linked to your account. Important We recommend changing the default name of an app to a more descriptive name before deployment, and it can be up to 128 characters long. Each unique app name creates a new application record in your New Relic UI, which allows you to: Run an application on more than one host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under the same name. Run multiple applications on a single host, and have all the data aggregated (collected) under different names. Assign the name in your config file To change the app name, set the app name value in the agent's configuration file. If you have deployed an app via one APM agent, and then deploy another app with the same name via a different APM agent, New Relic will automatically append the agent language name to the end of the second app's name. For example, if you deploy a Node.js app named New-App, and then deploy a .NET app named New-App, New Relic will automatically append the second app name as New-App (DOTNET). Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ;in your newrelic_app_config_t* config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java See the options for naming your Java application. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP See the options for naming your PHP application. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Change the application's alias The application name you set in the New Relic user interface is a human-readable alias. If you rename your app, the visible name is updated everywhere in the New Relic UI, including in linked browser apps. Initially, this alias is the same as the app's identifier name in the New Relic agent configuration file. However, changing the UI alias does not affect the underlying app name used for data rollup, which is set in the agent config file. The application must be actively reporting data to change the alias. Changing the UI alias will cause all agents that report under the app identifier to restart themselves. To change the alias for your application's name in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Application. In the Application alias field, type a new name (alias) for the selected app. Select Save application settings. Tip You can also change the app's alias with the New Relic REST API. Using multiple names for an app By giving your app multiple names, you can aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, docs category (index) views, and more. For succinct instructions, see Procedures, but it is highly recommended you understand the general concepts of how the docs site structure works if you will be doing larger docs site projects. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Nav files: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the nav folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like this one). Folder: We sometimes use \"folders\" to refer to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content section). This is a way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or subcategory: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to the various levels of docs site categories. For example, this view shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does this higher level category view. Index: In this context, an \"index\" is sometimes used to refer to a view of a certain category of docs (like this one). \"Index\" and \"category\" can be used a bit interchangably, but the gist is that the \"index\" term refers to a docs category being displayed in a page load. (Note that this is a different, more general use of the term than the index.mdx files that are used to build landing pages.) Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual docs folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure that we display (e.g., the structure shown in the sidebar and category views like this one). The displayed structure of the docs site is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the displayed site structure, which is used for the sidebar and category views, without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely parallel and matching. Because these two things are so separate, it means we have some fairly complex behind-the-scenes logic to get them to work together. And this means that there can be fairly unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes, and this means that you will have to add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL, so that means you would have to add a redirect to that doc for its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls these things: The docs structure (the various levels of docs) for that category of docs. The category headers, set by title (e.g., \"On-host integrations list\") and path (e.g., \"/docs/integrations/on-host-integrations\"). The doc information, set by title (e.g., \"NGINX integration\") and path (the doc's URL). A category and a doc in a nav file have the same elements: a title and a `path. What separates a category from a doc is that: A category contains docs in the level below it. If a category has a path (which isn't required but should be present for most docs), the path points to a content docs folder that has at least one doc in it. For more on nav file format, see Nav file format Where is the docs site structure exposed? The structure set in the nav files is exposed in two places: The left sidebar of a doc that shows the structure of that category. When a category header in the sidebar is clicked, it shows a view of that docs site category. Doc category views, also sometimes called index views: for example, this view, which shows a particular section of docs. What determines a doc's sidebar? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure governed by the nav files is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL in the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. If it finds that doc in more than one nav file, it attempts to find the right nav file by choosing the nav that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with a relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. For an example of a doc that is placed in two different nav files, in this category view click the Manage data doc and see how, when it loads, it displays the sidebar for the nav file that better matches its URL. When you click a sidebar category, what determines how that category view displays? When you click on a docs category header in the sidebar and a docs category view loads (like this one), what governs what is displayed there? Here is how this process works: A category header in the sidebar has an associated URL, which is set in the nav file. In the example nav file snippet below, the Get started category view has a path set to /docs/apis/intro-apis. This is what governs the sidebar heading title of \"Get started\" and tells it the URL to use. - title: APIs path: /docs/apis pages: - title: Get started path: /docs/apis/intro-apis pages: - title: New Relic APIs path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis - title: API keys path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys Copy If the associated folder of that path has an index mdx file (representing a landing page, like this one), the docs site displays that landing page. If there is no landing page, we check to see if that path matches an actual folder that has at least one mdx file. In other words, if we instead put in a completely arbitrary URL path for a category path, like docs/random-category/random-category-2, it would not work. It requires an existing folder with at least one doc in there. Other aspects to consider: Note that a category doesn't need a path link in the nav file; that is just what tells it to create a link and a URL for that view. If a category in a nav file lacks a path, it won't have a link or associated URL for it (for an example, see the \"New Relic University\" category in this section). Having a category without an associated link/URL can be an acceptable choice if you are creating a category of docs that don't reside in that section and you simply want to give a helpful category view in the sidebar. Note that every URL based on actual folder structure can create a theoretical URL. For example, here's a URL based on an actual folder containing one doc. But because there is no path in a nav file corresponding to that URL, it doesn't display anything. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc or the category view. Do not use trailing slashes. For docs categories in the nav file, the path is required to create an index view. Without the path, a docs category won't be clickable as a link and won't display a view of those docs. Learn more about index views. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide rootNav: false Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. It may help you to review the terms we use before starting a procedure. Procedures include: Add a new category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create a \"dummy\" category for docs that don’t live in that area Make a category heading clickable Troubleshoot messed up category views Add a new category We'll explain two procedures: adding a subcategory of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file. Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare, and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the structure of existing nav files as a template. For more on structure, see nav format. Tip You need at least one level of nesting inside the nav file. Without that, doc titles in the auto-generated category views will render as H2 headings. For example, src/content/level-one/level-two/doc will work, but src/content/level-one/doc will produce strange formatting. If you don't want your new nav to appear on the main landing page, add rootNav: false to your .yml file. (For an example of this, see src/nav/style-guide.yml.) Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title and path. If you're adding a path for that category (recommended), it must use the URL of an existing folder with at least one mdx file in it. Add the docs you want in that section. Ensure your new content matches the indenting of the surrounding nav file. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined If a category view isn't clickable, see Make category view clickable. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in one or more nav files. To do this: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the indenting based on the surrounding nav file content or other nav files. Add doc in multiple sidebar locations To add a doc in more than one sidebar location, simply add that doc (its title and path) wherever you want it to be in the nav file. For more on how the sidebar is determined for docs in multiple nav files, see Sidebar. You can add a doc URL in multiple nav file locations. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file You would move a doc in the nav file when you want to change its location in the displayed docs site structure (i.e., the sidebar and docs category views). To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure that new content is aligned properly with the surrounding nav file content. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move docs between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming very different, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create issues with category view displays or sidebar actions. Too much divergence can make finding and editing docs harder, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL. Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about ways to programmatically add redirects. Remove the trailing slash. Move the doc to the new folder. Update nav files with the new URL. This is easily overlooked but having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. If you are moving an entire folder or multiple folders to another folder, docs and all: Simply move these folders using your preferred method (e.g., using drag and drop) to the new location. Next, because that move changes all the URLs of the docs and categories, you'll need to add redirects: For adding redirects for docs, see the procedures for moving a doc between folders. For category redirects: For the section of the nav file affected by your folder editing, gather all the category URLs (path fields) that relate to the moved or deleted folders. We don't need to redirect all folder-related URL paths: we only need to redirect the nav file paths because those represent the paths that we actually link to in the docs (in other words: we aren't using folder-based URLs if they don't have a nav file path). Add those category path URLs as redirects in specific docs or, if that won't work, in the taxonomy-redirects file. We should aim to add category redirects in specific docs and the reason for this is that the taxonomy-redirects file is hard to use and because it's a better customer experience to land on a doc versus a category if possible. In most cases, you'll be able to find a fitting doc to redirect to but if only a category view makes sense, use the taxonomy redirects file. For larger projects, this can be tough work, so you'll want to check out the build and make sure all the sidebar links and category headers are working as expected. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: either moving or deleting the docs in those folders first, gathering the affected category path URLs and adding them as redirects, adn then deleting the empty folders. Create a \"dummy\" sub-category of docs that don't live in that category Sometimes you want to create a category of docs that is there to help expose a related doc or set of docs. For example, in this view, we have added a category for 'New Relic University' even though that's not a doc that lives in that section; in this case, it's not even a doc on our site. In the example above, this 'New Relic University' category header is in regular text and not a link, and that's because it doesn't have a path set for it in the nav file. This also means that in the sidebar, this category header is not a clickable link and simply functions as a collapser/expander. This is acceptable if you don't mind it but below we explain how you can get a clickable category if you need it. To create a so-called \"dummy\" category: Add the category structure you want in the nav file. If you're okay not having a clickable category header, your new category doesn't require a path. If you want a clickable category header, you will need to use or create a folder that matches the new category path and that has at least one mdx file in it (details). In the nav file, add the title and path information for the docs you want in that new category. Test your new category to ensure it is working correctly. Make a sidebar category heading clickable If there's a sidebar category that's only acting as an expander/collapser and doesn't have a link, that's because it either a) doesn't have a path set in the nav file, or b) that path goes to a folder that doesn't have a doc in it. For more on this, see the instructions regarding clickable headers in the \"dummy\" category section. Troubleshoot category views not working correctly If a docs category view is not working correctly, review how category views are formed. If this does happen, get another opinion from another tech writer to make sure you're not missing something, as we should rarely have problems. One reason that a category view might not work is specifically for path URLs that are also landing pages. In this case, if that path is used in more than one location in the same nav file, the docs site can be confused about which category view to use. We may fix this with a coding fix but in meantime: consider pointing to other URLs and not that path, so that there's only one use of that path per nav file.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework.

Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes.

      "body": "New Relic APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "New Relic APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled.

Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate.

      "body": "New Relic APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon.

      "body": "New Relic APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available. Important APM's configurable security policies is available in limited release for approved New Relic accounts. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Compatibility and requirements APM agent versions that support this feature include: C SDK: not available Go: 2.1 or higher Java: 4.1 or higher .NET: 8.1 or higher Node.js: 4.1 or higher PHP: 8.1 or higher Python: not available Ruby: 5.2 or higher Enable configurable security policies Caution Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support. If high security mode is enabled for the account(s), do not disable it. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file. High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API. For the limited release, there is no UI component. If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts: Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies. Choose the configurable security policies options that you want for those accounts. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen. Ensure your agent versions support this feature. Update agents if necessary. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See examples. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s). High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the account level. Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting. Example configuration Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies: Java agent: YAML example The Java agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy .NET agent: XML example The .NET agent uses a XML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: ... <configuration agentenabled=\"true\" xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> <service licensekey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <application> <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name> </application> <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken> <log level=\"info\"> </log></service></configuration> ... Copy If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this: NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN Copy Ruby agent: YAML example The Ruby agent uses a YAML file for configuration. Here is an example snippet enabling security policies: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME' security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info Copy Available policy options Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents. Setting Effect Database query collection Options: Enabled: Collects obfuscated database query data. Obfuscated queries generally appear along with slow query details in the APM or New Relic One UI. Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data. Raw query data is not collected once configurable security policies is enabled. attributes.include list Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Ruby only Options: Enabled: attributes.include list functions normally; attribute keys found in the attributes.include list are recorded. Disabled: Ignores the list of allowed attributes listed in the attributes.include property in agent configuration; no intrinsic request parameter attributes will be collected. Whitelisting attributes at the account level is not supported. Raw exception messages Options: Enabled: Allows recording of all raw exception messages. Disabled: Prevents recording of all raw exception messages. The messages may be either obfuscated or completely removed, depending on the agent. Custom events Options: Enabled: Allows the recording of custom events that are created and sent up via an agent API. Disabled: Prevents recording of any custom events collect by an agent API. Custom attributes Options: Enabled: Allows for the collection of custom attributes passed in by the New Relic agent. Disabled: Prevents collection of custom attributes that are collected by the New Relic agent. Custom instrumentation editor Java only Options: Enabled: Allows custom instrumentation of the agent, using the custom instrumentation editor. Disabled: Prevents custom instrumentation of the agent using the custom instrumentation editor. Instrumentation previously done via the editor is also disabled. Access to the custom instrumentation editor is only available to New Relic account Owners and Admins. Message parameters Java and Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of message parameters (message.parameters.*). Disabled: Prevents collection of message parameters. Job arguments Ruby only Options: Enabled: Allows the collection of job arguments (job.(type).args.*). Disabled: Prevents the collection of job arguments.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework.

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single New Relic-monitored app. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the below APM agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

      "body": "Problem The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler to access the profiling API of a process at any given time. If another profiler is installed on the system, the New Relic profiler will not instrument any applications. Solution To avoid a profiler conflict, fully remove the other profiler from the environment, then ensure the IIS registry keys or system environment variables have been restored. Exception: For conflicts with Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures specifically for SCOM. 1. Check for profiler conflicts. To see if there are any profiler conflicts: Run Process Explorer as an Administrator. To find your app's process, right-click the app, then select Properties > Environment. Verify that the New Relic CLSID and environment variables are included in the w3wp.exe, service, or non-IIS app environment details: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy 2. Compare registry keys to Process Explorer if necessary. If the conflicting profiler has been disabled and there is still an issue, compare the registry keys to Process Explorer to see which profiler is present. On the machine where you are experiencing this issue, check the WAS and W3SVC REG for IIS apps, or check your service keys or non-IIS app keys. To check registry keys with this... Do this... PowerShell If using Microsoft PowerShell, execute the following commands: (Get-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\WAS).GetValue(\"Environment\") (Get-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\W3SVC).GetValue(\"Environment\") Copy Command line If using cmd, do the following for either WAS and W3SVC REG or for your service/non-IIS app. Here is an example for an IIS application: On the command line, enter regedit. From the Registry Editor, select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > SYSTEM > CurrentControlSet > Services. If applicable, select the WAS folder. From the WAS folder's list of registry keys, double-click Environment, and verify that New Relic's CLSID and environment variables appear in the text box. If applicable, select the W3SVC folder. From the W3SVC folder's list of registry keys, double-click Environment, and verify that New Relic's CLSID and environment variables appear in the text box. 3. Restore New Relic registry keys or environment variables. Once the conflicting profiler has been disabled, you still may need to restore the New Relic registry keys or, if using Instrument All, the system-wide environment variables. To resolve the profiler conflict for IIS applications, either re-run the installer and use the Repair feature, or restore the registry settings manually using PowerShell: $HKLM = 2147483650 #HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE $reg = [wmiclass]\"\\\\.\\root\\default:StdRegprov\" $key = \"SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\W3SVC\" $name = \"Environment\" $value = \"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1\",\"COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\",\"NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\\",\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1\",\"CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\",\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\\" $reg.SetMultiStringValue($HKLM, $key, $name, $value) $key = \"SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WAS\" $name = \"Environment\" $value = \"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1\",\"COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\",\"NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\\",\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1\",\"CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\",\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\\" $reg.SetMultiStringValue($HKLM, $key, $name, $value) iisreset Copy For non-IIS applications and Windows services, either re-run the installer and use the Repair feature, or manually edit the system-wide environment variables. For some Windows services, a reboot is required to pick up the new variables. Cause Here are some commonly reported profiler conflicts. This is not an exhaustive list of .NET profilers, as any program that uses the .NET profiling API may cause conflicts with the New Relic .NET profiler.

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. { \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\": \"C:\\\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\\\newrelic.config\" } Copy",

      "body": "This guide outlines the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x versions of the .NET agent, issues that you may encounter while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 9.x. Main changes include: Distributed tracing is enabled by default Removal of deprecated public agent APIs Removal of deprecated configurable agent settings Distributed tracing enabled by default Distributed tracing is a feature that has existed in the .NET agent since July 2018. It replaces cross-application tracing (CAT) as the best way to quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through various services in a distributed application architecture. CAT will be deprecated in the .NET agent as of version 9.0, and will be removed in a future major release. In 8.x versions of the .NET agent, the default newrelic.config file installed on a host by any .NET agent installer would have the crossApplicationTracer element present and set enabled=”true”. The distributedTracing element was not present by default. In 9.x, this will be reversed: crossApplicationTracer will not be present by default, and distributedTracing will be present with the default value of enabled=”true”. However, the agent installers do not overwrite an existing newrelic.config file when upgrading from one version to another. Therefore, if you are upgrading the agent from 8.x to 9.x on a given host, the agent’s behavior on that host will not change. Tip If you wish to adopt the new default tracing behavior when upgrading from 8.x to 9.x, you will need to modify your agent configuration to enable distributed tracing. New installations of the 9.x agent on a host will have distributed tracing enabled by default. Removal of deprecated public agent API methods All deprecated API methods have replacement API methods with equivalent functionality. Tip If you are using the .NET agent API in your application code, we recommend that you update the package reference in your project to the latest 9.x version of the agent API assembly before upgrading the .NET agent to 9.x. That way, you will get compile-time errors if your code is using any of the API methods removed in 9.x. Important If you continue to use an 8.x or earlier version of the API assembly, and your code uses any of the deprecated APIs listed below, you will not get compile-time errors. However, if you then instrument your app with a 9.x version of the agent, the API methods will have no effect, and you will get run-time warning messages in the agent log file. Removed API Replacement API CreateDistributedTracePayload InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Creates W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AcceptDistributedTracePayload AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AddCustomParameter AddCustomAttribute AddCustomAttribute is a method of the ITransaction interface, so a reference to the current transaction is needed to use this API. GetBrowserTimingFooter GetBrowserTimingHeader GetBrowserTimingFooter has been marked Obsolete since agent version 3.x. Examples CreateDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Create the trace payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); // Add the trace payload to the headers of the outgoing request requestMessage.Headers.Set(NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey, payload.HttpSafe()); Copy replace it with this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Insert the distributed trace headers to the message. The “setter” // action tells the API how to add headers to the “carrier”, which // is the HttpWebRequest message in this example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Obtain the payload from the upstream request object HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; string payload = httpContext.Request.Headers[NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey)]; // Accept the payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(payload, TransportType.HTTP); Copy replace it with this: HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // The “Getter” method defines how to get headers from the carrier, // which is the HttpContext in this example IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } // Call the API currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); Copy AddCustomParameter If you previously had code that looked like this: // Called in code that runs inside a transaction created by the // agent, e.g. an ASP.NET WebApi endpoint NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy replace it with this: // Get the current transaction IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // Add the custom attribute to the current transaction currentTransaction.AddCustomAttribute(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy Removal of deprecated agent configuration settings The following agent configuration settings are being removed from the agent. In order to make the upgrade path from 8.x to 9.x as smooth as possible, we will not be removing the settings from the newrelic.config file XML schema. However, the agent’s internal configuration logic will be updated to ignore these settings, and log messages to the agent log file warning you that these configuration values no longer have any effect. A bit about notation: for ease of description, the rest of this section will describe configuration elements with a “dot notation” shorthand rather than full XML. For example, a configuration element that appears in your newrelic.config file may look like this: <configuration> <parameterGroups> <identityParameters> … </identityParameters> </parameterGroups> … </configuration> Copy In this example, it will be written as parameterGroups.IdentityParameters. Since all of these config elements are children of the top-level <configuration> element, it is omitted for the sake of brevity. Most of the configuration options being removed relate to capture or exclusion of attribute data. The following documents are helpful in understanding the big picture of agent attribute data collection and how it is configured: Agent attributes Enable and disable attributes (.NET) .NET attribute examples Removed configuration option Replacement configuration option parameterGroups.identityParameters.* attributes.include <parameterGroups> <identityParameter enabled=\"true\"/> </parameterGroups> Copy is equivalent to <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>identity.*</include> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.customParameters.enabled attributes.include parameterGroups.customParameters.ignore attributes.exclude parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParameter</exclude> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.responseHeaderParameters.* None requestParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. requestParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParamter</exclude> </attributes> Copy analyticsEvents.* transactionEvents.* All of the child config elements and attributes of analyticsEvents.* also exist in transactionEvents.* and have the same meaning, with the exception of the deprecated transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute option. Additionally, transactionEvents.attributes* gives finer control over inclusion and exclusion of custom attributes on transaction events. transactionTracer.captureAttributes transactionTracer.attributes.enabled transactionTracer.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with transaction traces. errorCollector.captureAttributes errorCollector.attributes.enabled errorCollector.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with error events. browserMonitoring.captureAttributes browserMonitoring.attributes.enabled browserMonitoring.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with browser monitoring data. errorCollector.ignoreErrors errorCollector.ignoreClasses For more information, see the error collection configuration documentation. transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute None This configuration element was not being used in the agent.",

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "This guide outlines the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x versions of the .NET agent, issues that you may encounter while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 9.x. Main changes include: Distributed tracing is enabled by default Removal of deprecated public agent APIs Removal of deprecated configurable agent settings Distributed tracing enabled by default Distributed tracing is a feature that has existed in the .NET agent since July 2018. It replaces cross-application tracing (CAT) as the best way to quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through various services in a distributed application architecture. CAT will be deprecated in the .NET agent as of version 9.0, and will be removed in a future major release. In 8.x versions of the .NET agent, the default newrelic.config file installed on a host by any .NET agent installer would have the crossApplicationTracer element present and set enabled=”true”. The distributedTracing element was not present by default. In 9.x, this will be reversed: crossApplicationTracer will not be present by default, and distributedTracing will be present with the default value of enabled=”true”. However, the agent installers do not overwrite an existing newrelic.config file when upgrading from one version to another. Therefore, if you are upgrading the agent from 8.x to 9.x on a given host, the agent’s behavior on that host will not change. Tip If you wish to adopt the new default tracing behavior when upgrading from 8.x to 9.x, you will need to modify your agent configuration to enable distributed tracing. New installations of the 9.x agent on a host will have distributed tracing enabled by default. Removal of deprecated public agent API methods All deprecated API methods have replacement API methods with equivalent functionality. Tip If you are using the .NET agent API in your application code, we recommend that you update the package reference in your project to the latest 9.x version of the agent API assembly before upgrading the .NET agent to 9.x. That way, you will get compile-time errors if your code is using any of the API methods removed in 9.x. Important If you continue to use an 8.x or earlier version of the API assembly, and your code uses any of the deprecated APIs listed below, you will not get compile-time errors. However, if you then instrument your app with a 9.x version of the agent, the API methods will have no effect, and you will get run-time warning messages in the agent log file. Removed API Replacement API CreateDistributedTracePayload InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Creates W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AcceptDistributedTracePayload AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AddCustomParameter AddCustomAttribute AddCustomAttribute is a method of the ITransaction interface, so a reference to the current transaction is needed to use this API. GetBrowserTimingFooter GetBrowserTimingHeader GetBrowserTimingFooter has been marked Obsolete since agent version 3.x. Examples CreateDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Create the trace payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); // Add the trace payload to the headers of the outgoing request requestMessage.Headers.Set(NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey, payload.HttpSafe()); Copy replace it with this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Insert the distributed trace headers to the message. The “setter” // action tells the API how to add headers to the “carrier”, which // is the HttpWebRequest message in this example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Obtain the payload from the upstream request object HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; string payload = httpContext.Request.Headers[NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey)]; // Accept the payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(payload, TransportType.HTTP); Copy replace it with this: HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // The “Getter” method defines how to get headers from the carrier, // which is the HttpContext in this example IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } // Call the API currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); Copy AddCustomParameter If you previously had code that looked like this: // Called in code that runs inside a transaction created by the // agent, e.g. an ASP.NET WebApi endpoint NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy replace it with this: // Get the current transaction IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // Add the custom attribute to the current transaction currentTransaction.AddCustomAttribute(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy Removal of deprecated agent configuration settings The following agent configuration settings are being removed from the agent. In order to make the upgrade path from 8.x to 9.x as smooth as possible, we will not be removing the settings from the newrelic.config file XML schema. However, the agent’s internal configuration logic will be updated to ignore these settings, and log messages to the agent log file warning you that these configuration values no longer have any effect. A bit about notation: for ease of description, the rest of this section will describe configuration elements with a “dot notation” shorthand rather than full XML. For example, a configuration element that appears in your newrelic.config file may look like this: <configuration> <parameterGroups> <identityParameters> … </identityParameters> </parameterGroups> … </configuration> Copy In this example, it will be written as parameterGroups.IdentityParameters. Since all of these config elements are children of the top-level <configuration> element, it is omitted for the sake of brevity. Most of the configuration options being removed relate to capture or exclusion of attribute data. The following documents are helpful in understanding the big picture of agent attribute data collection and how it is configured: Agent attributes Enable and disable attributes (.NET) .NET attribute examples Removed configuration option Replacement configuration option parameterGroups.identityParameters.* attributes.include <parameterGroups> <identityParameter enabled=\"true\"/> </parameterGroups> Copy is equivalent to <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>identity.*</include> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.customParameters.enabled attributes.include parameterGroups.customParameters.ignore attributes.exclude parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParameter</exclude> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.responseHeaderParameters.* None requestParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. requestParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParamter</exclude> </attributes> Copy analyticsEvents.* transactionEvents.* All of the child config elements and attributes of analyticsEvents.* also exist in transactionEvents.* and have the same meaning, with the exception of the deprecated transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute option. Additionally, transactionEvents.attributes* gives finer control over inclusion and exclusion of custom attributes on transaction events. transactionTracer.captureAttributes transactionTracer.attributes.enabled transactionTracer.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with transaction traces. errorCollector.captureAttributes errorCollector.attributes.enabled errorCollector.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with error events. browserMonitoring.captureAttributes browserMonitoring.attributes.enabled browserMonitoring.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with browser monitoring data. errorCollector.ignoreErrors errorCollector.ignoreClasses For more information, see the error collection configuration documentation. transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute None This configuration element was not being used in the agent.",

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "This guide outlines the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x versions of the .NET agent, issues that you may encounter while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 9.x. Main changes include: Distributed tracing is enabled by default Removal of deprecated public agent APIs Removal of deprecated configurable agent settings Distributed tracing enabled by default Distributed tracing is a feature that has existed in the .NET agent since July 2018. It replaces cross-application tracing (CAT) as the best way to quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through various services in a distributed application architecture. CAT will be deprecated in the .NET agent as of version 9.0, and will be removed in a future major release. In 8.x versions of the .NET agent, the default newrelic.config file installed on a host by any .NET agent installer would have the crossApplicationTracer element present and set enabled=”true”. The distributedTracing element was not present by default. In 9.x, this will be reversed: crossApplicationTracer will not be present by default, and distributedTracing will be present with the default value of enabled=”true”. However, the agent installers do not overwrite an existing newrelic.config file when upgrading from one version to another. Therefore, if you are upgrading the agent from 8.x to 9.x on a given host, the agent’s behavior on that host will not change. Tip If you wish to adopt the new default tracing behavior when upgrading from 8.x to 9.x, you will need to modify your agent configuration to enable distributed tracing. New installations of the 9.x agent on a host will have distributed tracing enabled by default. Removal of deprecated public agent API methods All deprecated API methods have replacement API methods with equivalent functionality. Tip If you are using the .NET agent API in your application code, we recommend that you update the package reference in your project to the latest 9.x version of the agent API assembly before upgrading the .NET agent to 9.x. That way, you will get compile-time errors if your code is using any of the API methods removed in 9.x. Important If you continue to use an 8.x or earlier version of the API assembly, and your code uses any of the deprecated APIs listed below, you will not get compile-time errors. However, if you then instrument your app with a 9.x version of the agent, the API methods will have no effect, and you will get run-time warning messages in the agent log file. Removed API Replacement API CreateDistributedTracePayload InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Creates W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AcceptDistributedTracePayload AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AddCustomParameter AddCustomAttribute AddCustomAttribute is a method of the ITransaction interface, so a reference to the current transaction is needed to use this API. GetBrowserTimingFooter GetBrowserTimingHeader GetBrowserTimingFooter has been marked Obsolete since agent version 3.x. Examples CreateDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Create the trace payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); // Add the trace payload to the headers of the outgoing request requestMessage.Headers.Set(NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey, payload.HttpSafe()); Copy replace it with this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Insert the distributed trace headers to the message. The “setter” // action tells the API how to add headers to the “carrier”, which // is the HttpWebRequest message in this example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Obtain the payload from the upstream request object HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; string payload = httpContext.Request.Headers[NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey)]; // Accept the payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(payload, TransportType.HTTP); Copy replace it with this: HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // The “Getter” method defines how to get headers from the carrier, // which is the HttpContext in this example IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } // Call the API currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); Copy AddCustomParameter If you previously had code that looked like this: // Called in code that runs inside a transaction created by the // agent, e.g. an ASP.NET WebApi endpoint NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy replace it with this: // Get the current transaction IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // Add the custom attribute to the current transaction currentTransaction.AddCustomAttribute(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy Removal of deprecated agent configuration settings The following agent configuration settings are being removed from the agent. In order to make the upgrade path from 8.x to 9.x as smooth as possible, we will not be removing the settings from the newrelic.config file XML schema. However, the agent’s internal configuration logic will be updated to ignore these settings, and log messages to the agent log file warning you that these configuration values no longer have any effect. A bit about notation: for ease of description, the rest of this section will describe configuration elements with a “dot notation” shorthand rather than full XML. For example, a configuration element that appears in your newrelic.config file may look like this: <configuration> <parameterGroups> <identityParameters> … </identityParameters> </parameterGroups> … </configuration> Copy In this example, it will be written as parameterGroups.IdentityParameters. Since all of these config elements are children of the top-level <configuration> element, it is omitted for the sake of brevity. Most of the configuration options being removed relate to capture or exclusion of attribute data. The following documents are helpful in understanding the big picture of agent attribute data collection and how it is configured: Agent attributes Enable and disable attributes (.NET) .NET attribute examples Removed configuration option Replacement configuration option parameterGroups.identityParameters.* attributes.include <parameterGroups> <identityParameter enabled=\"true\"/> </parameterGroups> Copy is equivalent to <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>identity.*</include> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.customParameters.enabled attributes.include parameterGroups.customParameters.ignore attributes.exclude parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParameter</exclude> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.responseHeaderParameters.* None requestParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. requestParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParamter</exclude> </attributes> Copy analyticsEvents.* transactionEvents.* All of the child config elements and attributes of analyticsEvents.* also exist in transactionEvents.* and have the same meaning, with the exception of the deprecated transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute option. Additionally, transactionEvents.attributes* gives finer control over inclusion and exclusion of custom attributes on transaction events. transactionTracer.captureAttributes transactionTracer.attributes.enabled transactionTracer.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with transaction traces. errorCollector.captureAttributes errorCollector.attributes.enabled errorCollector.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with error events. browserMonitoring.captureAttributes browserMonitoring.attributes.enabled browserMonitoring.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with browser monitoring data. errorCollector.ignoreErrors errorCollector.ignoreClasses For more information, see the error collection configuration documentation. transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute None This configuration element was not being used in the agent.",

      "body": "This document contains the configuration options for the APM .NET agent. Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "This guide outlines the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x versions of the .NET agent, issues that you may encounter while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 9.x. Main changes include: Distributed tracing is enabled by default Removal of deprecated public agent APIs Removal of deprecated configurable agent settings Distributed tracing enabled by default Distributed tracing is a feature that has existed in the .NET agent since July 2018. It replaces cross-application tracing (CAT) as the best way to quickly understand what happens to requests as they travel through various services in a distributed application architecture. CAT will be deprecated in the .NET agent as of version 9.0, and will be removed in a future major release. In 8.x versions of the .NET agent, the default newrelic.config file installed on a host by any .NET agent installer would have the crossApplicationTracer element present and set enabled=”true”. The distributedTracing element was not present by default. In 9.x, this will be reversed: crossApplicationTracer will not be present by default, and distributedTracing will be present with the default value of enabled=”true”. However, the agent installers do not overwrite an existing newrelic.config file when upgrading from one version to another. Therefore, if you are upgrading the agent from 8.x to 9.x on a given host, the agent’s behavior on that host will not change. Tip If you wish to adopt the new default tracing behavior when upgrading from 8.x to 9.x, you will need to modify your agent configuration to enable distributed tracing. New installations of the 9.x agent on a host will have distributed tracing enabled by default. Removal of deprecated public agent API methods All deprecated API methods have replacement API methods with equivalent functionality. Tip If you are using the .NET agent API in your application code, we recommend that you update the package reference in your project to the latest 9.x version of the agent API assembly before upgrading the .NET agent to 9.x. That way, you will get compile-time errors if your code is using any of the API methods removed in 9.x. Important If you continue to use an 8.x or earlier version of the API assembly, and your code uses any of the deprecated APIs listed below, you will not get compile-time errors. However, if you then instrument your app with a 9.x version of the agent, the API methods will have no effect, and you will get run-time warning messages in the agent log file. Removed API Replacement API CreateDistributedTracePayload InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Creates W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AcceptDistributedTracePayload AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts W3C Trace Context headers as well as New Relic distributed trace headers. AddCustomParameter AddCustomAttribute AddCustomAttribute is a method of the ITransaction interface, so a reference to the current transaction is needed to use this API. GetBrowserTimingFooter GetBrowserTimingHeader GetBrowserTimingFooter has been marked Obsolete since agent version 3.x. Examples CreateDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Create the trace payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); // Add the trace payload to the headers of the outgoing request requestMessage.Headers.Set(NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey, payload.HttpSafe()); Copy replace it with this: // Create an external web request to another instrumented service HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); // Insert the distributed trace headers to the message. The “setter” // action tells the API how to add headers to the “carrier”, which // is the HttpWebRequest message in this example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload If you previously had code that looked like this: // Obtain the payload from the upstream request object HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; string payload = httpContext.Request.Headers[NewRelic.Api.Agent.Constants.DistributedTracePayloadKey)]; // Accept the payload IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(payload, TransportType.HTTP); Copy replace it with this: HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // The “Getter” method defines how to get headers from the carrier, // which is the HttpContext in this example IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } // Call the API currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); Copy AddCustomParameter If you previously had code that looked like this: // Called in code that runs inside a transaction created by the // agent, e.g. an ASP.NET WebApi endpoint NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.AddCustomParameter(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy replace it with this: // Get the current transaction IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; // Add the custom attribute to the current transaction currentTransaction.AddCustomAttribute(“myCustomParameter”, “myValue”); Copy Removal of deprecated agent configuration settings The following agent configuration settings are being removed from the agent. In order to make the upgrade path from 8.x to 9.x as smooth as possible, we will not be removing the settings from the newrelic.config file XML schema. However, the agent’s internal configuration logic will be updated to ignore these settings, and log messages to the agent log file warning you that these configuration values no longer have any effect. A bit about notation: for ease of description, the rest of this section will describe configuration elements with a “dot notation” shorthand rather than full XML. For example, a configuration element that appears in your newrelic.config file may look like this: <configuration> <parameterGroups> <identityParameters> … </identityParameters> </parameterGroups> … </configuration> Copy In this example, it will be written as parameterGroups.IdentityParameters. Since all of these config elements are children of the top-level <configuration> element, it is omitted for the sake of brevity. Most of the configuration options being removed relate to capture or exclusion of attribute data. The following documents are helpful in understanding the big picture of agent attribute data collection and how it is configured: Agent attributes Enable and disable attributes (.NET) .NET attribute examples Removed configuration option Replacement configuration option parameterGroups.identityParameters.* attributes.include <parameterGroups> <identityParameter enabled=\"true\"/> </parameterGroups> Copy is equivalent to <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>identity.*</include> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.customParameters.enabled attributes.include parameterGroups.customParameters.ignore attributes.exclude parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. parameterGroups.requestHeaderParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParameter</exclude> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups.responseHeaderParameters.* None requestParameters.enabled attributes.include <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy Will include all request parameters. requestParameters.ignore attributes.exclude <attributes> <exclude>request.parameters.specificRequestParamter</exclude> </attributes> Copy analyticsEvents.* transactionEvents.* All of the child config elements and attributes of analyticsEvents.* also exist in transactionEvents.* and have the same meaning, with the exception of the deprecated transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute option. Additionally, transactionEvents.attributes* gives finer control over inclusion and exclusion of custom attributes on transaction events. transactionTracer.captureAttributes transactionTracer.attributes.enabled transactionTracer.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with transaction traces. errorCollector.captureAttributes errorCollector.attributes.enabled errorCollector.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with error events. browserMonitoring.captureAttributes browserMonitoring.attributes.enabled browserMonitoring.attributes.include/exclude gives finer control over which custom attributes to include with browser monitoring data. errorCollector.ignoreErrors errorCollector.ignoreClasses For more information, see the error collection configuration documentation. transactionEvents.maximumSamplesPerMinute None This configuration element was not being used in the agent.",

Important As of September 2021, a small subset of APIs, configuration options, and installation options for .NET will be replaced by new methods. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as: setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\agent\\directory (not configurable via config file) Copy Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown until the agent sends all data from the latest harvest cycle. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. ssl (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true The option to disable SSL is valid only for .NET agent versions 7.x and earlier. .NET agent version 8.x and higher communicate only via SSL. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomParameter. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (DEPRECATED) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. Important Infinite Tracing requires .NET Agent version 8.30 or higher. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and add the additional settings below <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location.

      "body": "This document explains how to install New Relic's .NET agent for application performance monitoring on your Azure Web App. (This is not the same as installing the infrastructure monitoring integrations for Microsoft Azure.) Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, the easiest and most reliable option is to use the publicly maintained Azure site extension. Note: Azure Site Extensions are only currently available for Windows App Service Resources. Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows <log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Log file configuration for Linux <log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure portal by going to New Relic Accounts > (select your app). Troubleshooting If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app got published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is not installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Refer to additional Azure troubleshooting procedures as applicable.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET agent on Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services platform. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. To make sure you are using the most relevant instructions, first see the .NET agent install overview. Important Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project). Check Web or Worker role's location If Service files are nested within a Solution folder, the NuGet installer cannot locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup, which will in turn prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service. Recommendation: Place the Web or Worker role at the root of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once the New Relic .NET agent is installed, you can move the Cloud role back into the Solution folder. Install the NuGet package for Cloud Services Important The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the new PackageReference format. For more information see Microsoft's package reference documentation For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting File > New > Project. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project). If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project. Open the Package Manager console by selecting Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Set your project as the default project. From the Package Manager command prompt, type Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure and press Enter. Follow the prompts to enter your New Relic license key and your application name as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name. From the Solution Explorer, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select Publish. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials. If applicable, instrument methods for Worker roles. Instrument Worker role A Worker role is a non-web process run as an Azure Cloud Service. To instrument a Worker role, you must create custom transactions. The .NET agent automatically instruments external calls and database calls, but it does not instrument default methods for transactions. Creating custom transactions solves this. After the Worker role starts up and the method executes, transaction data will appear in the APM Summary and Transactions pages under the Non-web category. The NuGet installer automatically adds the NewRelic.AppName parameter to the application config. This appears as <YOUR_WORKER_ROLE_NAME>.dll.config in E:\\approot. The .NET agent also automatically instruments WaWorkerHost.exe. This is the name of the actual Worker role process. Custom instrumentation example for Worker role This is a custom instrumentation example for a Worker role. It creates a custom transaction named ProcessMessage. The transaction begins when the ProcessMessage method is entered, and it ends when the method returns. The following example uses MyWorkerRole as the namespace. If you do not specify a name, it will default to the Solution name. namespace MyWorkerRole { public class NotificationQueue { public bool ProcessMessage(Message message) { // code to process message } } } Copy Here is the custom instrumentation file for the code: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-extension\"> <instrumentation> <tracerfactory name=\"NewRelic.Agent.Core.Tracer.Factories.BackgroundThreadTracerFactory\" metricName=\"Custom/ProcessMessage\"> <match assemblyname=\"MyWorkerRole\" classname=\"MyWorkerRole.NotificationQueue\"> <exactmethodmatcher methodName=\"ProcessMessage\" /> </match> </tracerfactory> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy On a local installation, place this instrumentation file in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Extensions. Custom instrumentation file deployment Optional: To send the custom instrumentation file up with an Azure Cloud Service deployment: In your Azure Cloud project, add the instrumentation file to your Worker role inside the Roles folder. After installing the New Relic .NET agent NuGet package, locate newrelic.cmd in your Worker Role project. Find the statement IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 within the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT block, and add the following statement to the conditional: IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\MyInstrumentation.xml\" \"%NR_HOME%\\extensions\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log ) ELSE ( Copy In this example, the newrelic.cmd batch file copies the custom instrumentation file to the Extensions folder in D:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\, or %NR_HOME%. This example uses MyInstrumentation.xml, but any name will work as long as the file name and copy command match, and the file is valid XML. Optional: Create custom config file You can create a custom configuration file in Visual Studio. This allows you to make changes to newrelic.config inside Visual Studio, without having to remote into your Azure Role instance every time you make a change. Whenever you publish your app, the config file in Visual Studio is automatically uploaded to the remote host. The choices you make with the installation wizard do not matter. Installing locally does not affect your Azure development environment. In Visual Studio, select the Solution Explorer, then open NewRelicAgent_x64_XYZ.msi. Follow the steps to install the agent locally. Import newrelic.config into your project: In Solution Explorer > Cloud Project, right-click the Web Role, then select Add > Existing Item. Navigate to C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent and select newrelic.config. From C: \\ ProgramData \\ New Relic \\ .NET Agent, edit newrelic.cmd. In the :INSTALL_NEWRELIC_AGENT section, find this statement: IF $ERRORLEVEL% EQU 0 ( Copy Add the following code as another statement inside the IF block, then save the file: copy /Y \"%RoleRoot%\\approot\\newrelic.config\" \"%NR_HOME%\" >> %RoleRoot%\\nr.log Copy You can now edit the newrelic.config hosted in Visual Studio. Whenever you publish your app, the copy command will upload the config file to the remote host. View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the troubleshooting procedures for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). The APM Summary page automatically appears. You can also view detailed information about errors, database and instance performance issues, and more. If you created your New Relic app prior to October 2017, you can use the Azure Portal to select the New Relic account blade. You will be automatically logged in with SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) to APM. You can also view your application's error rate and throughput data in the Azure Portal by going to New Relic Accounts > choose your application.",

      "body": "This document explains how to install APM's .NET Framework agent and .NET Core agent on Azure Service Fabric. This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures. When using NuGet, you must set some environment variables. This can be done in your application's ServiceManifest.xml file. See the relevant instructions below: .NET Framework In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage Name=\"Code\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> </CodePackage> <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Windows In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Linux In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\"./newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\"./newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy For the .NET Framework only: Edit your app.config file and add the NewRelic.AgentEnabled app setting: <appSettings> ... <add key=\"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"true\" /> ... </appSettings> Copy If your application is generating traffic, data should appear in your APM account in several minutes.

      "body": "This document explains how to install New Relic's .NET agent for application performance monitoring on your Azure Web App. (This is not the same as installing the infrastructure monitoring integrations for Microsoft Azure.) Recommendation: Before following these instructions, read the .NET agent installation overview. Installation options Use any of the following methods to add the New Relic .NET agent to your Azure-deployed web app. The best option depends on your role, environment, deployments, etc. For example: For operations teams that need to monitor the app, the easiest and most reliable option is to use the publicly maintained Azure site extension. Note: Azure Site Extensions are only currently available for Windows App Service Resources. Install using the Azure Site Extension For developer teams, or anyone needing to deploy the agent on a Linux App Service Resource, installing via nuget is the best option: Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) Install using NuGet (.NET Core) In order to monitor non-web apps (including WebJobs), or ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, you must explicitly enable the agent for that application's .exe process via one of these two methods: Enable via placement of local newrelic.config file. Enable via application config file In addition, WebJobs may need custom instrumentation for transactions to appear in APM, and additional configuration if they run for less than one minute. Disable Application Insights Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our Application Insights troubleshooting procedures. Install using the New Relic Azure Site Extension (Windows Only) To install the .NET agent for an Azure Web App using the New Relic Azure Site Extension: Shut down your web application before installing the New Relic Azure Site Extension. Add the site extension: Navigate to http://[yoursitename].scm.azurewebsites.net, then select Site extensions > Gallery. Select the plus icon next to the New Relic site extension. In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app to use the new version of the agent. Install using NuGet (.NET Framework) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old packages.config. They do not support the current PackageReference format. For more information, see Microsoft's package reference documentation. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific web app project) before installing the NuGet package. If you are upgrading the .NET Framework agent using NuGet, any changes you made in the newrelic.config will be overwritten. To preserve any changes, save your newrelic.config outside of your project, then restore it after upgrading. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: In the Azure portal, verify your Azure Platform (32-bit or 64-bit): From the Azure sidebar menu, select App Services > Your Application > Settings > Configuration > General settings. Open your application in Visual Studio, and install the New Relic NuGet package by running the appropriate command from the Package manager console: 32-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites 64-bit: Install-Package NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.x64 Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value COR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 COR_PROFILER {71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} COR_PROFILER_PATH D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Install using NuGet (.NET Core) The NuGet installation method packages the New Relic Agent with your application so that it is available to the Azure Web App Host. New Relic .NET Core agent supports Linux and Windows applications on Azure App Services. The installation process for Azure App Services differs from the .NET Core agent installation procedures for Linux and Windows. To install the .NET agent on an Azure Web App using NuGet: Install the NewRelic.Agent NuGet package. Modify the log node by adding a directory attribute to your newrelic.config file (Note: If Visual Studio prevents you from editing the newrelic.config file that was added to your project by NuGet then you will need to make a local copy of this in your application): Log file configuration for Windows <log directory=\"D:\\Home\\LogFiles\\NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Log file configuration for Linux <log directory=\"/home/LogFiles/NewRelic\" level=\"info\"></log> Copy Publish your application. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Settings > Configuration. From Configuration, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Environment variables for Windows Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_32 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\x86\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH_64 D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME D:\\Home\\site\\wwwroot\\newrelic Environment variables for Linux Key Value CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING 1 CORECLR_PROFILER {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME /home/site/wwwroot/newrelic NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY /home/LogFiles/NewRelic In the Azure portal, add New Relic app settings to your Azure App Service. Restart your web app. Add New Relic app settings to Azure App Services To add your app settings: Make sure you have your license key before adding the New Relic .NET agent's app settings. In the Azure portal, open the web app you want to monitor, then select Configuration > Application settings. From Application settings, select + New application setting and add these key/value pairs: Key Value NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY YOUR_LICENSE_KEY NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME YOUR_APP_NAME Save and restart your web app. Setting the license key and app name with Application settings will override the newrelic.config. To verify your app's environment variables in your app's Kudu diagnostic console, go to Environment > Environment variables. For example: https://myappname.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env.cshtml#envVariables Copy View your app's performance Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic.

This is not the same as installing the Infrastructure integrations for Microsoft Azure. Install .NET agent on Azure Service Fabric Important In most cases, installing the .NET agent in an Azure Service Fabric environment can be performed using the standard install procedures for either Windows or Linux. This document highlights some alternate ways you can install the agent. You will need to ensure the agent gets installed on all nodes in your cluster. To monitor multiple nodes, you may want to integrate the install into your deployment process. If you are using containers in your Service Fabric environment you should read Install for Docker. You can also install the agent in a Service Fabric environment using NuGet. NuGet is often a good option for developers because the agent gets deployed along with your application. Though, using NuGet requires some manual installation procedures. See Install with NuGet. Install using NuGet To install the .NET agent using NuGet: Follow the standard NuGet install procedures. When using NuGet, you must set some environment variables. This can be done in your application's ServiceManifest.xml file. See the relevant instructions below: .NET Framework In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage Name=\"Code\" Version=\"1.0.0\"> </CodePackage> <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"COR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Windows In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\".\\newrelic\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\".\\newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy .NET Core for Linux In the ServiceManifest.xml file in your project, include the following under the CodePackage node: <CodePackage> ... <EntryPoint> <ExeHost> ... <!-- It is important for the WorkingFolder to be set to CodePackage --> <!-- This is because the environment variables set below rely on this being the working folder for the agent to work --> <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder> ... </ExeHost> </EntryPoint> ... <EnvironmentVariables> ... <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING\" Value=\"1\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER\" Value=\"{36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH\" Value=\"./newrelic/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME\" Value=\"./newrelic\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Value=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" /> <EnvironmentVariable Name=\"NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME\" Value=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" /> ... </EnvironmentVariables> ... </CodePackage> Copy For the .NET Framework only: Edit your app.config file and add the NewRelic.AgentEnabled app setting: <appSettings> ... <add key=\"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"true\" /> ... </appSettings> Copy If your application is generating traffic, data should appear in your APM account in several minutes. If data does not appear, try these troubleshooting steps: Make sure that all files in the newrelic directory at the root of your app was published to Azure. Make sure the environment variables are set correctly. See the general troubleshooting documentation to check for common errors.",
