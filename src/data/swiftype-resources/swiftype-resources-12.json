      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Machines reports data about your VMs service, like the VM ID, the VM size, the availability set, and the region name. You can monitor and alert on your Azure VMs data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards. Requirements Requirements include: New Relic infrastructure agent installed with Infrastructure agent version 1.0.775 or higher. (Update the infrastructure agent.) New Relic Azure integrations activated Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Important You must install the infrastructure agent on each VM to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Azure subscription allows New Relic to access VM metadata. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Virtual Machines integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and look for the integration. You can query and explore your data using the AzureVirtualMachineSample event type. The provider value is AzureVirtualMachine. For more on how to find and use integration data, see Understand and use data. Inventory data Inventory data is information about your system's state and configuration. For details on how to find and use inventory data, see Understand and use data. The Azure Virtual Machines integration reports this inventory data: availabilitySet bootDiagnosticsEnabled image linuxConfiguration name networkInterfaces osDisk provisioningState regionName resourceGroupName (deprecates resourceGroup) vmId vmSize windowsConfiguration Other system data The Azure Virtual Machines integration also collects the following attributes about the service and its configuration: Region Availability zone Instance type Instance ID Troubleshooting If you use Host not reporting alert conditions, the importing of Azure metadata for your VMs will change the hosts registry and result in false alert notifications. To prevent false positives: For each Azure instance, disable its Host not reporting alert condition. Update the infrastructure agent for all instances that used this alert condition. Re-enable each Host not reporting alert condition.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "The New Relic Kafka on-host integration reports metrics and configuration data from your Kafka service. We instrument all the key elements of your cluster, including brokers (both ZooKeeper and Bootstrap), producers, consumers, and topics. Read on to install the Kafka integration, and to see what data it collects. To monitor Kafka with our Java agent, see Instrument Kafka message queues. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Kafka versions 0.8 or higher. callout.info Topic data collection is supported for Kafka versions 0.11.0.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: If Kafka is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running Kafka. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Java 8 or higher JMX enabled on all brokers Java-based consumers and producers only, and with JMX enabled Total number of monitored topics must be fewer than 10000 For Kafka running on Kubernetes, see the Kubernetes requirements. Prepare for the installation Kafka is a complex piece of software that is built as a distributed system. For this reason, you’ll need to ensure that the integration can contact all the required hosts and services so the data is collected correctly. Autodiscovery Given the distributed nature of Kafka, the actual number and list of brokers is usually not fixed by the configuration, and it is instead quite dynamic. For this reason, the Kafka integration offers two mechanisms to perform automatic discovery of the list of brokers in the cluster: Bootstrap and Zookeeper. The mechanism you use depends on the setup of the Kafka cluster being monitored. Bootstrap With the bootstrap mechanism, the integration uses a bootstrap broker to perform the autodiscovery. This is a broker whose address is well known and that will be asked for any other brokers it is aware of. The integration needs to be able to contact this broker in the address provided in the bootstrap_broker_host parameter for bootstrap discovery to work. Zookeeper Alternatively, the Kafta integration can also talk to a Zookeeper server in order to obtain the list of brokers. To do this, the integration needs to be provided with the following: The list of Zookeeper hosts to contact (zookeeper_hosts). The proper authentication secrets to connect with the hosts. Together with the list of brokers it knows about, Zookeeper will also advertise which connection mechanisms are supported by each broker. You can configure the Kafka integration to try directly with one of these mechanisms with the preferred_listener parameter. If this parameter is not provided, the integration will try to contact the brokers with all the advertised configurations until one of them succeeds. Tip The integration will use Zookeeper only for discovering brokers and will not retrieve metrics from it. Topic listing To correctly list the topics processed by the brokers, the integration needs to to contact brokers over the Kafka protocol. Depending on how the brokers are configured, this might require setting up SSL and/or SASL to match the broker configuration. Broker monitoring (JMX) The Kafka integration queries JMX, a standard Java extension for exchanging metrics in Java applications. JMX is not enabled by default in Kafka brokers, and you need to enable it for metrics collection to work properly. JMX requires RMI to be enabled, and the RMI port needs to be set to the same port as JMX. You can configure JMX to use username/password authentication, as well as SSL. If such features have been enabled in the broker's JMX settings, you need to configure the integration accordingly. Important We do not recommend enabling anonymous and/or unencrypted JMX/RMI access on public or untrusted network segments because this poses a big security risk. Producer/consumer monitoring (JMX) Producers and consumers written in Java can also be monitored through the same mechanism (JMX). JMX needs to be enabled and configured on those applications where it is not enabled by default. Non-Java producers and consumers do not support JMX and are therefore not supported by the Kafka integration. Connectivity requirements As a summary, the integration needs to be configured and allowed to connect to: Hosts listed in zookeeper_hosts over the Zookeeper protocol, using the Zookeeper authentication mechanism (if autodiscover_strategy is set to zookeeper). Hosts defined in bootstrap_broker_host over the Kafka protocol, using the Kafka broker’s authentication/transport mechanisms (if autodiscover_strategy is set to bootstrap). All brokers in the cluster over the Kafka protocol and port, using the Kafka brokers' authentication/transport mechanisms. All brokers in the cluster over the JMX protocol and port, using the authentication/transport mechanisms specified in the JMX configuration of the brokers. All producers/consumers specified in producers and consumers over the JMX protocol and port, if you want producer/consumer monitoring. JMX settings for the consumer must be the same as for the brokers. Important For the cloud: By default, Security Groups (and their equivalents in other cloud providers) in AWS do not have the required ports open by default. JMX requires two ports in order to work: the JMX port and the RMI port. These can be set to the same value when configuring the JVM to enable JMX and must be open for the integration to be able to connect to and collect metrics from brokers. Install and activate To install the Kafka integration, choose your setup: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-kafka. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp kafka-config.yml.sample kafka-config.yml Copy Edit the kafka-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-kafka installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-kafka/nri-kafka-amd64-installer.exe To install from the Windows command prompt, run: PATH\\TO\\nri-kafka-amd64-installer.exe Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp kafka-config.yml.sample kafka-config.yml Copy Edit the kafka-config.yml configuration as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The entire environment can be monitored remotely or on any node in that environment. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, kafka-config.yml. For examples of typical configurations, see the example configurations. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The configuration accepts the following commands: inventory: collects configuration status metrics: collects performance metrics consumer_offset: collects consumer group offset data Arguments The configuration accepts the following arguments: General arguments: cluster_name: user-defined name to uniquely identify the cluster being monitored. Required. kafka_version: the version of the Kafka broker you're connecting to, used for setting optimum API versions. Defaults to 1.0.0. Versions older than 1.0.0 may be missing some features. autodiscover_strategy: the method of discovering brokers. Options are zookeeper or bootstrap.

Example configuration Tip For more details on configuration parameters, see the kafka-config.yml.sample config file on GitHub. Example: Single agent deployment Let's consider an environment with the following structure. For this environment, assume the infrastructure agent is installed on the ZooKeeper node. Brokers Single ZooKeeper node Single producer: Name: my-producer Host: my-producer.my.localnet JMX Port: 9989 Single consumer: Name: my-consumer Host: my-consumer.my.localnet JMX Port: 9987 Example kafka-config.yml config file for this environment: integration_name: com.newrelic.kafka instances: - name: kafka-metrics command: metrics arguments: zookeeper_hosts: '[{\"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 2181}]' producers: '[{\"name\": \"my-producer\", \"host\": \"my-producer.my.localnet\", \"port\": 9989}]' consumers: '[{\"name\": \"my-consumer\", \"host\": \"my-consumer.my.localnet\", \"port\": 9987}]' topic_mode: List collect_topic_size: false topic_list: '[\"topic_1\", \"topic_2\"]' labels: env: production role: kafka - name: kafka-inventory command: inventory arguments: zookeeper_hosts: '[{\"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 2181}]' topic_mode: Regex topic_regex: 'topic_[0-9]+' labels: env: production role: kafka Copy Example: Multiple agent deployment Let's consider an environment with the following structure. For this environment, assume the infrastructure agent is installed on the ZooKeeper node, the producer node, and the consumer node. Brokers Single ZooKeeper node Single producer: Name: my-producer Host: my-producer.my.localnet JMX Port: 9989 Single consumer: Name: my-consumer Host: my-consumer.my.localnet JMX Port: 9987 Example kafka-config.yml config file for this environment: ZooKeeper node configuration: integration_name: com.newrelic.kafka instances: - name: kafka-metrics command: metrics arguments: zookeeper_hosts: '[{\"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 2181}]' topic_mode: List collect_topic_size: false topic_list: '[\"topic_1\", \"topic_2\"]' labels: env: production role: kafka - name: kafka-inventory command: inventory arguments: zookeeper_hosts: '[{\"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 2181}]' topic_mode: List topic_list: '[\"topic_1\", \"topic_2\"]' labels: env: production role: kafka Copy Producer node configuration: integration_name: com.newrelic.kafka instances: - name: kafka-metrics command: metrics arguments: producers: '[{\"name\": \"my-producer\", \"host\": \"my-producer.my.localnet\", \"port\": 9989}]' topic_mode: List topic_list: '[\"topic_1\", \"topic_2\"]' labels: env: production role: kafka Copy Consumer node configuration: integration_name: com.newrelic.kafka instances: - name: kafka-metrics command: metrics arguments: consumers: '[{\"name\": \"my-consumer\", \"host\": \"my-consumer.my.localnet\", \"port\": 9987}]' topic_mode: List topic_list: '[\"topic_1\", \"topic_2\"]' labels: env: production role: kafka Copy Example: Offset collection Let's consider an environment with the following structure. For this environment, assume the infrastructure agent is installed on the ZooKeeper node. Important Due to the load that collecting offset data can put on the Kafka environment, collecting offsets is done independently of normal metric and inventory data collection. We recommend installing the offset collection only on one node. Brokers Single ZooKeeper node Consumers Consumer Groups consumer_group_a1 consumer_group_a2 consumer_group_b1 For this example environment, if you want to monitor offsets for only consumer_group_a1 and consumer_group_a2, a sample config might look like this: integration_name: com.newrelic.kafka - name: kafka-consumer-offsets command: consumer_offset arguments: zookeeper_hosts: '[{\"host\": \"localhost\", \"port\": 2181}]' consumer_group_regex: 'consumer_group_a.' labels: env: production role: kafka Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Kafka data is attached to the following event types: KafkaBrokerSample KafkaTopicSample KafkaProducerSample KafkaConsumerSample KafkaOffsetSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Kafka integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as broker. or consumer.. KafkaBrokerSample event Metric Description broker.bytesWrittenToTopicPerSecond Number of bytes written to a topic by the broker per second. broker.IOInPerSecond Network IO into brokers in the cluster in bytes per second. broker.IOOutPerSecond Network IO out of brokers in the cluster in bytes per second. broker.logFlushPerSecond Log flush rate. broker.messagesInPerSecond Incoming messages per second. follower.requestExpirationPerSecond Rate of request expiration on followers in evictions per second. net.bytesRejectedPerSecond Rejected bytes per second. replication.isrExpandsPerSecond Rate of replicas joining the ISR pool. replication.isrShrinksPerSecond Rate of replicas leaving the ISR pool. replication.leaderElectionPerSecond Leader election rate. replication.uncleanLeaderElectionPerSecond Unclean leader election rate. replication.unreplicatedPartitions Number of unreplicated partitions. request.avgTimeFetch Average time per fetch request in milliseconds. request.avgTimeMetadata Average time for metadata request in milliseconds. request.avgTimeMetadata99Percentile Time for metadata requests for 99th percentile in milliseconds. request.avgTimeOffset Average time for an offset request in milliseconds. request.avgTimeOffset99Percentile Time for offset requests for 99th percentile in milliseconds. request.avgTimeProduceRequest Average time for a produce request in milliseconds. request.avgTimeUpdateMetadata Average time for a request to update metadata in milliseconds. request.avgTimeUpdateMetadata99Percentile Time for update metadata requests for 99th percentile in milliseconds. request.clientFetchesFailedPerSecond Client fetch request failures per second. request.fetchTime99Percentile Time for fetch requests for 99th percentile in milliseconds. request.handlerIdle Average fraction of time the request handler threads are idle. request.produceRequestsFailedPerSecond Failed produce requests per second. request.produceTime99Percentile Time for produce requests for 99th percentile. KafkaConsumerSample event Metric Description consumer.avgFetchSizeInBytes Average number of bytes fetched per request for a specific topic. consumer.avgRecordConsumedPerTopic Average number of records in each request for a specific topic. consumer.avgRecordConsumedPerTopicPerSecond Average number of records consumed per second for a specific topic in records per second. consumer.bytesInPerSecond Consumer bytes per second. consumer.fetchPerSecond The minimum rate at which the consumer sends fetch requests to a broke in requests per second. consumer.maxFetchSizeInBytes Maximum number of bytes fetched per request for a specific topic. consumer.maxLag Maximum consumer lag. consumer.messageConsumptionPerSecond Rate of consumer message consumption in messages per second. consumer.offsetKafkaCommitsPerSecond Rate of offset commits to Kafka in commits per second. consumer.offsetZooKeeperCommitsPerSecond Rate of offset commits to ZooKeeper in writes per second. consumer.requestsExpiredPerSecond Rate of delayed consumer request expiration in evictions per second. KafkaProducerSample event Metric Description producer.ageMetadataUsedInMilliseconds Age in seconds of the current producer metadata being used. producer.availableBufferInBytes Total amount of buffer memory that is not being used in bytes. producer.avgBytesSentPerRequestInBytes Average number of bytes sent per partition per-request. producer.avgCompressionRateRecordBatches Average compression rate of record batches. producer.avgRecordAccumulatorsInMilliseconds Average time in ms record batches spent in the record accumulator. producer.avgRecordSizeInBytes Average record size in bytes. producer.avgRecordsSentPerSecond Average number of records sent per second. producer.avgRecordsSentPerTopicPerSecond Average number of records sent per second for a topic. producer.AvgRequestLatencyPerSecond Producer average request latency. producer.avgThrottleTime Average time that a request was throttled by a broker in milliseconds. producer.bufferMemoryAvailableInBytes Maximum amount of buffer memory the client can use in bytes. producer.bufferpoolWaitTime Faction of time an appender waits for space allocation. producer.bytesOutPerSecond Producer bytes per second out. producer.compressionRateRecordBatches Average compression rate of record batches for a topic. producer.iOWaitTime Producer I/O wait time in milliseconds. producer.maxBytesSentPerRequestInBytes Max number of bytes sent per partition per-request. producer.maxRecordSizeInBytes Maximum record size in bytes. producer.maxRequestLatencyInMilliseconds Maximum request latency in milliseconds. producer.maxThrottleTime Maximum time a request was throttled by a broker in milliseconds. producer.messageRatePerSecond Producer messages per second. producer.responsePerSecond Number of producer responses per second. producer.requestPerSecond Number of producer requests per second. producer.requestsWaitingResponse Current number of in-flight requests awaiting a response. producer.threadsWaiting Number of user threads blocked waiting for buffer memory to enqueue their records. KafkaTopicSample event Metric Description topic.diskSize Current topic disk size per broker in bytes. topic.partitionsWithNonPreferredLeader Number of partitions per topic that are not being led by their preferred replica. topic.respondMetaData Number of topics responding to meta data requests. topic.retentionSizeOrTime Whether a partition is retained by size or both size and time. A value of 0 = time and a value of 1 = both size and time. topic.underReplicatedPartitions Number of partitions per topic that are under-replicated. KafkaOffsetSample event Metric Description consumer.offset The last consumed offset on a partition by the consumer group. consumer.lag The difference between a broker's high water mark and the consumer's offset (consumer.hwm - consumer.offset). consumer.hwm The offset of the last message written to a partition (high water mark). consumer.totalLag The sum of lags across partitions consumed by a consumer. consumerGroup.totalLag The sum of lags across all partitions consumed by a consumerGroup. consumerGroup.maxLag The maximum lag across all partitions consumed by a consumerGroup. Inventory data The Kafka integration captures the non-default broker and topic configuration parameters, and collects the topic partition schemes as reported by ZooKeeper. The data is available on the Inventory UI page under the config/kafka source. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Duplicate data being reported For agents monitoring producers and/or consumers, and that have Topic mode set to All:, there may be a problem of duplicate data being reported. To stop the duplicate data: ensure that the configuration option Collect topic size is set to false. Integration is logging errors 'zk: node not found' Ensure that zookeeper_path is set correctly in the configuration file. JMX connection errors The Kafka integration uses a JMX helper tool called nrjmx to retrieve JMX metrics from brokers, consumers, and producers. JMX needs to be enabled and configured on all brokers in the cluster. Also, firewalls need to be tuned to allow connections from the host running the integration to the brokers over the JMX port. To check whether JMX is correctly configured, run the following command for each broker from the machine running the Kafka integration. Replace the highlighted PORT, USERNAME, and PASSWORD tokens with the corresponding JMX settings for the brokers: $ echo \"*:*\" | nrjmx -hostname HOSTNAME -port PORT -v -username USERNAME -password PASSWORD Copy The command should generate the output showing a long series of metrics without any errors. Kerberos authentication failing The integration might show an error like the following: KRB Error: (6) KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN Client not found in Kerberos database Copy Check the keytab with kinit command. Replace the highlighted fields with your values: $ kinit -k -t KEY_TAB_PATH USERNAME Copy If the username/keytab combination is correct, the command above should finish without printing any errors. Check the realm using klist command: $ klist |grep \"Default principal:\" Copy You should see something like this: Default principal: johndoe@a_realm_name Copy Check that the printed user name and realm match the sasl_gssapi_realm and sasl_gssapi_username parameters in the integration configuration. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

If our pre-built integrations don't meet your needs, you can use the Telemetry SDKs to build your own telemetry tools. Under the hood, data reported by these solutions are ingested via our data ingest APIs.

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application.

      "body": "New Relic APM agents, browser agents, and mobile agents report a type of metric data called metric timeslice data. These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic. New Relic agent Implementation APM agents C SDK: newrelic_record_custom_metric() Go: app.RecordCustomMetric Java: recordMetric .NET: RecordMetric Node.js: recordMetric PHP: newrelic_custom_metric Python: record_custom_metric and register_data_source Ruby: record_metric and increment_metric New Relic mobile agents Android: recordMetric iOS: recordMetricWithName (Objective-C) or NewRelic.recordMetricWithName (Swift) New Relic browser agent Browser does not support custom metrics. For options on adding custom data to browser, see browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic.

For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic.

All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity.

      "body": "You can send OpenTelemetry data to New Relic and analyze the results in our observability platform. This introduction can help you decide if you want to get started with OpenTelemetry. If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic.

For options on adding custom data to browser, see browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add browser monitoring agent instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the UI, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements Automatic browser instrumentation is supported for most recent versions of Rails: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Use the example configuration file, or look at the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file, which includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map and an example configuration. Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Docker container. Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the http://localhost:8080/metrics endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself. Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Start the integration in the background: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:1.5 Copy Confirm the container is running properly: docker ps -f \"name=nri-prometheus\" Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Kubernetes installation Important To prevent your data from being duplicated, configure your New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration only with one replica. Running two or more replicas will result in duplicated data. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures for restarts and gaps in data. To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest .yaml file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file: Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. env: - name: LICENSE_KEY value: \"<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>\" [...] config.yaml: | cluster_name: \"<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>\" Copy Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. By default, the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the deployment has been created successfully, look at the CURRENT replicas in the results generated by this command: kubectl get deployments nri-prometheus Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Update the integration To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker or Kubernetes as applicable: Docker update procedures Remove the Docker container. Follow standard installation procedures to start a new Docker container. The integration logs its current version when it starts up. To determine the running version: docker logs nri-prometheus 2>&1 | grep \"Integration version\" Copy Example output: time=\"2019-02-26T09:21:21Z\" level=info msg=\"Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version 1.0.0 \" Copy Kubernetes update procedures Follow standard installation procedures. Reapply the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file. The integration logs its version when it starts up. To determine the running version: kubectl logs deploy/nri-prometheus | grep \"Integration version\" Copy Example output: time=\"2019-02-26T09:21:21Z\" level=info msg=\"Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version 1.0.0 \" Copy Uninstall To uninstall the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, execute the following command: Docker: docker rm -f nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: kubectl delete -f nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration.

Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license.

There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points.

For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024.

PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter.

Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of. Important For general information about Prometheus queries and operators, see the Prometheus.io documentation. Supported features We support the following aggregation, arithmetic, mathematical, and rate-like functions. As we continue to expand support for Prometheus and PromQL, this list will be updated. Aggregation operators and functions Aggregation operators: avg() count() min() max() quantile() stddev() stdvar() sum() topk() Aggregation functions: histogram_quantile() <aggregation>_over_time() functions: avg_over_time count_over_time min_over_time max_over_time quantile_over_time stdev_over_time stvar_over_time sum_over_time Arithmetic binary operators + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) / (division) % (percent) ^ (power/exponents) Logical operators and or Date/time functions day_of_month() day_of_week() days_in_month() hour() minute() month() time() timestamp() year() Mathematical functions abs() ceil() clamp_max() clamp_min() exp() floor() ln() log10() log2() round() sqrt() Rate-like functions delta() deriv() idelta() increase() irate() rate() Predictive functions predict_linear Time-series selectors We offer support for PromQL time-series selectors including the following: instant vector selectors range series selectors offset modifier Important We only support offset queries if every vector in the query has the same offset value. PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of. Important For general information about Prometheus queries and operators, see the Prometheus.io documentation. Supported features We support the following aggregation, arithmetic, mathematical, and rate-like functions. As we continue to expand support for Prometheus and PromQL, this list will be updated. Aggregation operators and functions Aggregation operators: avg() count() min() max() quantile() stddev() stdvar() sum() topk() Aggregation functions: histogram_quantile() <aggregation>_over_time() functions: avg_over_time count_over_time min_over_time max_over_time quantile_over_time stdev_over_time stvar_over_time sum_over_time Arithmetic binary operators + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) / (division) % (percent) ^ (power/exponents) Logical operators and or Date/time functions day_of_month() day_of_week() days_in_month() hour() minute() month() time() timestamp() year() Mathematical functions abs() ceil() clamp_max() clamp_min() exp() floor() ln() log10() log2() round() sqrt() Rate-like functions delta() deriv() idelta() increase() irate() rate() Predictive functions predict_linear Time-series selectors We offer support for PromQL time-series selectors including the following: instant vector selectors range series selectors offset modifier Important We only support offset queries if every vector in the query has the same offset value. PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base.

Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration.

Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. Open source project categories New Relic Open Source Projects are assigned to one of five different categories. These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account. Community projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github or Community. New Relic One catalog: Support requests can be made through the Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. Example code: Project support is through Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. New Relic experimental: Projects have no ongoing maintenance, development or support. Archived: Projects are read-only, are not actively maintained, and do not have support. Open source support includes Support for Community Plus Projects from New Relic’s Global Technical Support includes: Troubleshooting problems with the Community Plus Projects on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues with Community Plus Projects during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration of Community Plus Projects in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data with Community Plus Projects into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines with Community Plus Projects Identifying bugs in Community Plus Projects Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Open source support does not include Open source projects assigned to categories other than the Community Plus category Unsupported environments & frameworks Code development End of Life Beta or Limited Release Troubleshooting of customer environment Troubleshooting third-party tools and services Product training Consultancy services Support videos For a library of additional videos, webinars, and other information about using New Relic features, visit New Relic University and newrelic.com/resources.

      "body": "You can use the Prometheus remote write integration to get data flowing into New Relic. Once you integrate, your data will be visible in query-based dashboards (and other query results), often within about five minutes. Why it matters Unlike Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, which scrape data from Prometheus endpoints, the remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. You can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries and dashboards and beyond. With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional) Compatibility New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Scale your data and get moving quickly Once logged in to New Relic, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. View your data. What's next Ready to get started? Read the setup documentation. Configure a Prometheus data source in Grafana.

Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: http://newrelic.com/terms IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION. 1. DEFINITIONS “FIT Instrumentation” means the New Relic custom-made software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the FIT Instrumentation shall be treated like an “Agent”, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the FIT Instrumentation solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the FIT Instrumentation and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the FIT Instrumentation in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the FIT Instrumentation, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the FIT Instrumentation is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that FIT Instrumentation will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions.

Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER. THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE AND NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING. THE ADD-ON IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ERROR-FREE, COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS FROM USE OF THE ADD-ON THEREFROM. 4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION. Customer agrees and acknowledges that: (a) the Add-on is not an official product and has not been commercially released for sale by New Relic; (b) the Add-on may not operate properly, being in final form, or fully functional; (c) the Add-on may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, design flaws, or other problems; (d) it may not be possible to make the Add-on fully functional; (e) the information obtained using the Add-on may not be accurate; (f) use of the Add-on may result in unexpected results, loss of data, delays or other unpredictable damages or loss; (g) New Relic is under no obligation to release a commercial version of the Add-on; and (h) New Relic has the right unilaterally to abandon development of the Add-on, at any time and without any obligation or liability to Customer. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1 Terms of Service; Documentation. This Agreement shall be considered a part of the New Relic documentation, located at: https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation). This Agreement and the Terms of Service constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-on. In the absence of a separate agreement, upon agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-On, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern the relationship between New Relic and Customer with respect to such Add-On. To the extent of a conflict between the Agreement and the Terms of Service, this Agreement shall govern with respect to the Add-on only.",

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER. THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE AND NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING. THE ADD-ON IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ERROR-FREE, COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS FROM USE OF THE ADD-ON THEREFROM. 4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION. Customer agrees and acknowledges that: (a) the Add-on is not an official product and has not been commercially released for sale by New Relic; (b) the Add-on may not operate properly, being in final form, or fully functional; (c) the Add-on may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, design flaws, or other problems; (d) it may not be possible to make the Add-on fully functional; (e) the information obtained using the Add-on may not be accurate; (f) use of the Add-on may result in unexpected results, loss of data, delays or other unpredictable damages or loss; (g) New Relic is under no obligation to release a commercial version of the Add-on; and (h) New Relic has the right unilaterally to abandon development of the Add-on, at any time and without any obligation or liability to Customer. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1 Terms of Service; Documentation. This Agreement shall be considered a part of the New Relic documentation, located at: https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation). This Agreement and the Terms of Service constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-on. In the absence of a separate agreement, upon agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-On, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern the relationship between New Relic and Customer with respect to such Add-On.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "This is a glossary of terms that appear in contracts for our original product-based pricing. For New Relic One pricing plan terms, see New Relic One pricing definitions. App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers.

For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the New Relic documentation, which can be found at https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation”).

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the New Relic documentation, which can be found at https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation”).

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic.

We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below. To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the New Relic Properties and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “New Relic Properties”) and is part of the New Relic documentation, which can be found at https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation”).

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER. THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE AND NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING. THE ADD-ON IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ERROR-FREE, COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS FROM USE OF THE ADD-ON THEREFROM. 4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION. Customer agrees and acknowledges that: (a) the Add-on is not an official product and has not been commercially released for sale by New Relic; (b) the Add-on may not operate properly, being in final form, or fully functional; (c) the Add-on may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, design flaws, or other problems; (d) it may not be possible to make the Add-on fully functional; (e) the information obtained using the Add-on may not be accurate; (f) use of the Add-on may result in unexpected results, loss of data, delays or other unpredictable damages or loss; (g) New Relic is under no obligation to release a commercial version of the Add-on; and (h) New Relic has the right unilaterally to abandon development of the Add-on, at any time and without any obligation or liability to Customer. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1 Terms of Service; Documentation. This Agreement shall be considered a part of the New Relic documentation, located at: https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation).

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

If you subscribe to New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained in your Terms are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products on a product-based pricing basis, any service level availability commitment are contained in (i) your Terms, or (ii) if your Terms explicitly references this Service Level Availability commitment applying to the Service purchased in an Order, this page for the Services you use. Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in your Terms. New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement. This describes Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for failures of Service Availability.

(“New Relic”) Pre-Release Services (as further defined), you signify that you have read, understood, and accept the terms of this Pre-Release Policy (the “Policy”) governing your use and participation in New Relic’s program for making beta, alpha and pre-release versions of New Relic software (i.e. agents, SDKs, APIs, integrations, private locations, code, etc.), services, features, user-interfaces, and platforms made available for evaluation purposes (the “Pre-Release Service(s)”).

YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 4.4 Modifications. New Relic may change the Policy from time to time as our business changes and technology evolves, and future versions of our generally available services may not be compatible with Pre-Release Service(s) built using previous versions. The most current version of this Policy will be posted in the Documentation. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately for all users in instances to comply with applicable law, for new users of a Pre-Release Service(s) and, for all other users, any changes to this Policy will be effective as of fifteen (15) days after posting notice of such changes.

We may require you to provide consent to the updated Policy in a specified manner before further use of the Pre-Release Service(s) is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s), your sole remedy is to stop using the Pre-Release Service(s) and any such termination by you shall be without penalty except as specified in this Policy. Otherwise, your use of any Pre-Release Service(s) after any such update shall constitute acceptance of the then-current Policy. 5.

NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS POLICY, THE PRE-RELEASE SERVICES, OR ANY UNINTENDED EFFECTS WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND YOU. 6. Indemnity You agree to indemnify and hold New Relic, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and licensors harmless from any claims, fees, fines, demands, losses, liabilities, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from or related to your use of the Pre-Release Service(s), including but not limited to allegations arising from your breach of any terms herein and/or allegations that data processed by the Pre-Release Service(s) violates or infringes the privacy, data protection, or intellectual property rights of a third party. 7.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

(“New Relic”) Pre-Release Services (as further defined), you signify that you have read, understood, and accept the terms of this Pre-Release Policy (the “Policy”) governing your use and participation in New Relic’s program for making beta, alpha and pre-release versions of New Relic software (i.e. agents, SDKs, APIs, integrations, private locations, code, etc.), services, features, user-interfaces, and platforms made available for evaluation purposes (the “Pre-Release Service(s)”). This Policy is effective on behalf of yourself or the entity(ies) associated with your New Relic account (collectively referred to herein as “you” or “your”) as of your date of first use of the Pre-Release Service(s) (the “Effective Date”), which means that your choice to use the Pre-Release Service(s) means that you have the legal authority to use the Pre-Release Service(s) personally or on behalf of the company or organization associated with your New Relic account in accordance with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully as your use of Pre-Release Service(s) may have unintended consequences and materially impact your data or use of the New Relic services and products.

Introduction This Policy and any New Relic technical guides and documentation made available with the Pre-Release Service(s) or from the dedicated ‘Documentation’ page of the New Relic website (the “Documentation”) enables you to test experimental features and products before they are made generally available. New Relic reserves the right to withhold or discontinue any Pre-Release Service(s), which may be designated as an alpha, beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, technology preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description, in its sole discretion and provides no guarantee that any Pre-Release Service(s) will eventually be made commercially or generally available.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions.

Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

      "body": "The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription. New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as February 19, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the New Relic One - Standard User (Full Stack Observability Standard) Product, you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms.",

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.
