You’re in control because you understand your system New Relic helps you cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems by bringing together and connecting data from any instrumented source and environment, without having to jump between tools. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. All the answers in one place As a full user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our more curated observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find the signal. Start anywhere Being fully-connected, New Relic allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

It’s getting the whole picture of everything that enables your applications and devices to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. You’re in control because you understand your system New Relic helps you cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems by bringing together and connecting data from any instrumented source and environment, without having to jump between tools. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. All the answers in one place As a full user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our more curated observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find the signal. Start anywhere Being fully-connected, New Relic allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.

Agent connection When an infrastructure agent connects to New Relic, our platform generates an Agent connected event. If New Relic doesn't receive data from an agent for three minutes, the platform generates an Agent disconnected event. Inventory changes These events are generated when inventory data is added, removed, or modified. Select the source icon to to understand which category corresponds to the altered inventory path. For additional details, select an inventory event to see a side-by-side comparison of the old and new state. Inventory events can include: Kernel (includes modules and configuration): Can be added, modified, or deleted. Metadata (includes various additional information about hosts): Can be added, modified, or deleted. Packages: Can be installed, removed, or modified. Services: Can be started, stopped, or restarted. Sessions (includes users): Can be connected or disconnected. Events page features To view the live event feed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. The Events page includes a heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the selected time range. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events: Use the Events to view important, real-time activity in your infrastructure. With the Events page, you can easily search through your event log to quickly find vulnerable packages. If you want to... Do this... Focus on specific events Use the Search events field to look for specific events, config changes or agent installations. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. Search within a particular time range Enter a time range to the right of the search bar to investigate events within a specific time range. For example, if you encountered a CPU spike around 11am on the previous day, search Yesterday at 11 am to investigate the possible cause. Compare events with host load, memory, CPU, and more View the events feed on the Hosts page. To compare infrastructure events and performance for a specific time, select a range via the time picker or drag and select a range on a chart. View events specifically related to agents, config, metadata, services, or sessions Group or sort events by selecting the filter icon be the search bar. Drill down into additional details Select an event to view additional details, such as attributes and values.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (e.g. newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz) maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is logged. Once an error has been logged, the cached debug messages are logged, but only the most recent number of configured debug messages. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, after an error is logged, only the 10 most recent debug messages are logged, and older logs are discarded. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this...

When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage.

Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU data center, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL). Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent. Learn how to manage the agent.",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU data center, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag.

Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Update your license key in config_defaults.sh. Optional: Update any other environment parameters in the configuration file. Execute installer.sh with admin rights. The script automatically identifies your service manager. If it fails, it will prompt you to manually update it. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. See our docs for more information. Configure your installation The configuration file config_defaults.sh serves as a source of reference for all the configuration options. It contains the following environment parameters: Variable Description NRIA_AGENT_DIR Required at agent startup. The agent home directory. Default: /var/db/newrelic-infra/ Copy NRIA_BIN_DIR Required at installation. The path to the agent binary folder. Default: /usr/local/bin Copy NRIA_CONFIG_FILE Required at installation.

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME . Copy Run the container from the image you built with the required required run flags: docker run \\ -d \\ --name newrelic-infra \\ --network=host \\ --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \\ --privileged \\ --pid=host \\ -v \"/:/host:ro\" \\ -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" \\ YOUR_IMAGE_NAME Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next? Docker Compose Create a folder to store the configuration files: mkdir ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Change directory to the one you've just created: cd ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" > newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create the newrelic-infra.dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: touch newrelic-infra.dockerfile Copy vim newrelic-infra.dockerfile #you can use any text editor Copy Put the following content in the file: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create docker-compose.yaml: touch docker-compose.yaml Copy vim docker-compose.yaml #you can use any text editor Copy Put following content in the file: version: '3' services: agent: container_name: newrelic-infra build: context: . dockerfile: newrelic-infra.dockerfile cap_add: - SYS_PTRACE network_mode: host pid: host privileged: true volumes: - \"/:/host:ro\" - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" restart: unless-stopped Copy Build and start docker-compose: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next? Basic setup To use the basic setup with a base New Relic infrastructure image: Docker CLI Run the container with the required run flags: docker run \\ -d \\ --name newrelic-infra \\ --network=host \\ --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \\ --privileged \\ --pid=host \\ -v \"/:/host:ro\" \\ -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" \\ -e NRIA_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ newrelic/infrastructure:latest Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next?

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key.

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux 2 All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

      "body": "The infrastructure agent is a lightweight piece of software, designed to minimize its impact on the performance of your hosts. However, the exact load varies depending on your host's workload, particularly on the number of processes running on the host. This is because the agent collects detailed data from each individual process. As a general guideline, New Relic has collected benchmarks for some common types of hosts: Linux single-task host The agent has very low performance overhead on a classic, single-task host. For example, a server running Apache, Unicorn, or a single Java application. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "With the infrastructure agent, you can monitor not only individual servers, but also understand how your service performs as a whole. The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent is a lightweight piece of software, designed to minimize its impact on the performance of your hosts. However, the exact load varies depending on your host's workload, particularly on the number of processes running on the host. This is because the agent collects detailed data from each individual process. As a general guideline, New Relic has collected benchmarks for some common types of hosts: Linux single-task host The agent has very low performance overhead on a classic, single-task host. For example, a server running Apache, Unicorn, or a single Java application. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

      "body": "Uninstalling the infrastructure agent does not directly affect any of your infrastructure Integrations: if you uninstall the agent, your integrations will remain. Similarly, if you disable or uninstall your integrations, the infrastructure agent will remain. To uninstall any of your integrations, follow the procedure corresponding to the type of integration. Cloud integrations AWS You can disable infrastructure AWS integrations and still retain the connection between your AWS account and New Relic. We recommend not to disable your EC2 and EBS integrations because those add important metadata to your infrastructure data. If you want to... Do this Disable one or more AWS service integrations To disable services while keeping your AWS account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all AWS integrations To disconnect your AWS account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your AWS account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that AWS account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to AWS and select Services > IAM > Roles. Select the checkbox for the role you want to delete, then select Role Actions > Delete Role. Unlinking your AWS account will disable the trust relationship set up via your ARN. Azure If you want to... Do this Disable one or more Azure service integrations To disable services while keeping your Azure account linked to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all Azure integrations To disconnect your Azure account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your Azure account. This requires being either the user who registered the app or an administrator. This procedure will disable all New Relic integrations associated with that Azure account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to Azure and go into All Services > Identity > App registrations, or go to Azure Active Directory service and select App registrations. Find the registered app (the recommended name is NewRelic-Integrations). To see the full list of available apps, select the dropdown menu beside the search field and select All apps. Select the app and, on the panel that opens, select Delete. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) If you want to... Do this Disable one or more GCP service integrations To disable services while keeping your GCP account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all GCP integrations To disconnect your GCP account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your GCP account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that GCP account. If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions. Here are some examples: Apache Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-apache yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-apache zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-apache Cassandra Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-cassandra yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-cassandra zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-cassandra Kubernetes Each cluster will have a single node where kubectl is running. To uninstall the Kubernetes integration, use the following command on each of these nodes: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy MySQL Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-mysql yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-mysql zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-mysql NGINX Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-nginx yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-nginx zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-nginx Redis Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-redis yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-redis zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-redis StatsD cd /path/to/statsd npm uninstall @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend From the StatsD config.js, remove the \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" entry from the list of backends. Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Tip To install the infrastructure agent for the first time, see the installation documentation for Linux, Windows, or configuration management tools. To uninstall the infrastructure agent, see Uninstall the Infrastructure agent. View the infrastructure agent version The infrastructure agent does not update itself automatically. Check the infrastructure agent release notes to make sure you have the latest agent version. To view the current infrastructure agent version for a host, use any of these options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Agents > Agent version. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts > (select a host). Create a query for SystemSample. Update the agent for installs using the package manager If you used the default installation process, use your package manager to update the program and its dependencies to the latest version. Here are examples for some common systems: Update using apt ( Debian, Ubuntu) To manually update the infrastructure agent with apt-get: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade newrelic-infra -y Copy Update using yum ( Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL) To manually update the infrastructure agent with yum: sudo yum update newrelic-infra -y Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update using Zypper ( SLES) To manually update the infrastructure agent with Zypper: sudo zypper -n update newrelic-infra Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on Windows Server (32 bits) To manually update the infrastructure agent on Windows Server: Download the latest .MSI installer image from download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/386/newrelic-infra-386.msi Run the install script.

Update on macOS To manually update the infrastructure agent on macOS, open the terminal and run the following commands: Stop the service (if already running): brew services stop newrelic-infra-agent Copy Uninstall the agent: brew update newrelic-infrastructure Copy Update with config management tools To update the infrastructure agent using your configuration management tool, see the documentation for your tool: Configure with Ansible Configure with Chef Configure with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Configure with Puppet Update the agent for assisted and manual tarball installs Important Since there are are no automated scripts, old files may remain when you update. Be sure to manually remove outdated files. To update the agent, download the file again and follow the installation procedure for Linux (assisted or manual) or Windows (assisted or manual). This will overwrite your old installation. Update the containerized version of the agent Use the latest label to ensure that our Docker image is automatically updated. Identify outdated agent versions from the UI You can use the Infrastructure monitoring UI to search for outdated agent versions: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory * * * * . In the search bar, type newrelic-infra. Select a group's dropdown to see the agent versions for that group. To manually check the infrastructure agent versions, you can log onto a server and run newrelic-infra --version, or the applicable command for your package manager.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Uninstalling the infrastructure agent does not directly affect any of your infrastructure Integrations: if you uninstall the agent, your integrations will remain. Similarly, if you disable or uninstall your integrations, the infrastructure agent will remain. To uninstall any of your integrations, follow the procedure corresponding to the type of integration. Cloud integrations AWS You can disable infrastructure AWS integrations and still retain the connection between your AWS account and New Relic. We recommend not to disable your EC2 and EBS integrations because those add important metadata to your infrastructure data. If you want to... Do this Disable one or more AWS service integrations To disable services while keeping your AWS account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all AWS integrations To disconnect your AWS account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your AWS account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that AWS account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to AWS and select Services > IAM > Roles. Select the checkbox for the role you want to delete, then select Role Actions > Delete Role. Unlinking your AWS account will disable the trust relationship set up via your ARN. Azure If you want to... Do this Disable one or more Azure service integrations To disable services while keeping your Azure account linked to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all Azure integrations To disconnect your Azure account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your Azure account. This requires being either the user who registered the app or an administrator. This procedure will disable all New Relic integrations associated with that Azure account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to Azure and go into All Services > Identity > App registrations, or go to Azure Active Directory service and select App registrations. Find the registered app (the recommended name is NewRelic-Integrations). To see the full list of available apps, select the dropdown menu beside the search field and select All apps. Select the app and, on the panel that opens, select Delete. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) If you want to... Do this Disable one or more GCP service integrations To disable services while keeping your GCP account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all GCP integrations To disconnect your GCP account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your GCP account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that GCP account. If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions. Here are some examples: Apache Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-apache yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-apache zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-apache Cassandra Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-cassandra yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-cassandra zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-cassandra Kubernetes Each cluster will have a single node where kubectl is running. To uninstall the Kubernetes integration, use the following command on each of these nodes: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy MySQL Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-mysql yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-mysql zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-mysql NGINX Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-nginx yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-nginx zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-nginx Redis Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-redis yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-redis zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-redis StatsD cd /path/to/statsd npm uninstall @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend From the StatsD config.js, remove the \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" entry from the list of backends. Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services. Manually start, stop, restart, or check the agent status.",

Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures.

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services. Manually start, stop, restart, or check the agent status.",

The infrastructure agent might execute any integration defined in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR directory with Administrator permissions. You can configure the following parameters during the assisted install for Windows: Variable Description NRIA_AGENT_DIR Required at agent startup. The agent home directory. Default: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra Copy NRIA_APP_DATA_DIR This configures the data directory to store inventory and other agent files. Default: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra Copy NRIA_CONFIG_FILE Required at installation. The agent configuration file's location. Default: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml Copy NRIA_LICENSE_KEY Only configuration option required at startup. The New Relic license key. NRIA_LOG_FILE Required at agent startup. The location where the agent will log. Default: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy NRIA_OVERWRITE By default and for security reasons, Windows does not install a service if there's another service with the same name already installed. To bypass this check, make sure this setting NRIA_OVERWRITE is TRUE. Default: TRUE Copy NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR Required at agent startup. The directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Default: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d Copy NRIA_SERVICE_NAME This provides the name for the Windows service. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services. Manually start, stop, restart, or check the agent status.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details.

      "body": "New Relic's integrations include an integration for reporting your Microsoft Azure SQL Database metrics and inventory data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported. Features New Relic gathers database data from Azure's fully-managed relational cloud database service. Azure SQL provides single databases with their own set of resources, and elastic pools that share a set of resources. Both are associated with an Azure SQL Database logical server. If databases are protected by a firewall, they can be replicated and restored to a previous point in time. Using New Relic, you can: View Azure SQL Database data in pre-built Infrastructure dashboards. Run custom queries and visualize the data. Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. New Relic queries your Azure Database services according to a default polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Polling frequency for the Azure SQL Database integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To explore your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > (select an integration).

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "We provide hundreds of solutions to get your data into New Relic so you can analyze the data in one place. They give you a steady flow of useful data to fix problems quickly, maintain complex systems, improve your code, and accelerate your digital transformation. You can bring in data from hundreds of applications, frameworks, services, operating systems, and other technologies. Our integrations gather the data, and the agents send it to New Relic. The solution you need may require you to install both an integration and an agent. In some cases, you can just install our agents that contain integrations, such as our APM agents. Whatever data you need to bring in, chances are that we have options for your environment. If you prefer to make your own solutions, we also offer tools to get you started. Choose what's right for you We offer a wide range of solutions so you can easily collect data across your environment. You may only need one of our solutions to get the data you need, or you can choose a variety of options to capture a broader range of data types. Go to New Relic Integrations to find solutions that fit your environment. Here is a sample of what you’ll find there: Application performance monitoring (APM): C, Go, Java, Node, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby Mobile apps: Android and iOS Browser monitoring: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari Host monitoring: Linux and Microsoft Windows Cloud platform monitoring: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Core infrastructure services: Kubernetes, NGINX, MySQL, and more Open source telemetry integrations: Prometheus, Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, and more Create your own solutions If you are looking for custom options, we have tools to help you create your own: Use New Relic Flex to create lightweight monitoring solutions using infrastructure monitoring. Use New Relic Telemetry SDKs to build custom solutions for sending metrics, traces, and more. Build your own New Relic One applications that you can share with your colleagues, or edit open source applications in our catalog.",

      "body": "If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Before you install New Relic for Go, ensure your system meets these requirements. Golang versions New Relic supports Golang 1.7 or higher. Operating environments The agent supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can also use the Go agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Integrations The following integration packages extend the base newrelic package to support other frameworks and libraries. If frameworks and databases don't have an integration package, you can still instrument them using the newrelic package primitives.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "We provide hundreds of solutions to get your data into New Relic so you can analyze the data in one place. They give you a steady flow of useful data to fix problems quickly, maintain complex systems, improve your code, and accelerate your digital transformation. You can bring in data from hundreds of applications, frameworks, services, operating systems, and other technologies. Our integrations gather the data, and the agents send it to New Relic. The solution you need may require you to install both an integration and an agent. In some cases, you can just install our agents that contain integrations, such as our APM agents. Whatever data you need to bring in, chances are that we have options for your environment. If you prefer to make your own solutions, we also offer tools to get you started. Choose what's right for you We offer a wide range of solutions so you can easily collect data across your environment. You may only need one of our solutions to get the data you need, or you can choose a variety of options to capture a broader range of data types. Go to New Relic Integrations to find solutions that fit your environment. Here is a sample of what you’ll find there: Application performance monitoring (APM): C, Go, Java, Node, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby Mobile apps: Android and iOS Browser monitoring: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari Host monitoring: Linux and Microsoft Windows Cloud platform monitoring: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Core infrastructure services: Kubernetes, NGINX, MySQL, and more Open source telemetry integrations: Prometheus, Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, and more Create your own solutions If you are looking for custom options, we have tools to help you create your own: Use New Relic Flex to create lightweight monitoring solutions using infrastructure monitoring. Use New Relic Telemetry SDKs to build custom solutions for sending metrics, traces, and more. Build your own New Relic One applications that you can share with your colleagues, or edit open source applications in our catalog.",

Golang versions New Relic supports Golang 1.7 or higher. Operating environments The agent supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can also use the Go agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Integrations The following integration packages extend the base newrelic package to support other frameworks and libraries. If frameworks and databases don't have an integration package, you can still instrument them using the newrelic package primitives. For more information about instrumenting your database using these primitives, see the Go agent's datastore segments documentation on GitHub.

The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. The New Relic Go agent version 1.4 or higher supports instance details for all database drivers. Connect the agent to other features The Go agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Go agent sends default events and attributes to New Relic for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction. Browser monitoring The Go agent has an API for returning the browser agent's JavaScript. After using this API method on each request, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app.",

They give you a steady flow of useful data to fix problems quickly, maintain complex systems, improve your code, and accelerate your digital transformation. You can bring in data from hundreds of applications, frameworks, services, operating systems, and other technologies. Our integrations gather the data, and the agents send it to New Relic. The solution you need may require you to install both an integration and an agent. In some cases, you can just install our agents that contain integrations, such as our APM agents. Whatever data you need to bring in, chances are that we have options for your environment. If you prefer to make your own solutions, we also offer tools to get you started. Choose what's right for you We offer a wide range of solutions so you can easily collect data across your environment. You may only need one of our solutions to get the data you need, or you can choose a variety of options to capture a broader range of data types. Go to New Relic Integrations to find solutions that fit your environment. Here is a sample of what you’ll find there: Application performance monitoring (APM): C, Go, Java, Node, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby Mobile apps: Android and iOS Browser monitoring: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Apple Safari Host monitoring: Linux and Microsoft Windows Cloud platform monitoring: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Core infrastructure services: Kubernetes, NGINX, MySQL, and more Open source telemetry integrations: Prometheus, Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, and more Create your own solutions If you are looking for custom options, we have tools to help you create your own: Use New Relic Flex to create lightweight monitoring solutions using infrastructure monitoring.

You can also use the Go agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Integrations The following integration packages extend the base newrelic package to support other frameworks and libraries. If frameworks and databases don't have an integration package, you can still instrument them using the newrelic package primitives.

The New Relic Go agent version 1.4 or higher supports instance details for all database drivers. Connect the agent to other features The Go agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Go agent sends default events and attributes to New Relic for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction. Browser monitoring The Go agent has an API for returning the browser agent's JavaScript. After using this API method on each request, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected.

      "body": "With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can combine filters into a filter set to organize hosts based on criteria that matter the most to you. Read on to learn about the benefits, use, and logic of filter sets. Benefits of filter sets You can create filter sets using available attributes or tags. For example, you can organize your infrastructure into categories such as: Regions Operating system versions Hosts associated with Docker containers Test environments You can share filter sets with other people in your account, and you can quickly identify infrastructure problems by checking the color-coded health status of each host in the filter set. Create filter sets The default infrastructure filter set is All hosts, and it serves as a template for you to create filter sets. To create a filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. If All hosts is not displayed in the left sidebar, open that filter set by selecting Saved filter sets > All hosts. In All hosts, click Filter hosts. In the list, click an item to see a list of values. Click Include or Exclude (see Filter set logic). Click values individually or enter text to match multiple values. Continue adding filters until you have the filter set you want. To name your filter, click the icon, type a name, and click Save. Edit filter sets To change an existing filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. In the sidebar, click an option to update your filter set, and then save. Delete filter sets You can delete any saved filter set except the default All hosts. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Filter sets. Click to delete the filter set. Combine filter sets with grouping On some pages you can use Group by to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, on the Hosts page, you can group by awsRegion to display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage. Grouping applies to the selected filter sets. By combining filter sets with grouping, you can find detailed system information quickly. For an example of using these tools to troubleshoot a problem, see Combining filter sets and grouping. Copy filters from filter set to alerts When you create an alert condition, you can build filters individually, or you can copy all the filters from a filter set into a new alert condition. This is a quick shortcut to populate a new alert condition with some filters. Important When you copy filter set filters to a new alert condition, these filters are no longer tied to the filter set. If you make changes to the filter set, the alert filters are not affected. To copy filter set filters to a new alert condition: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. Mouse over any chart and click > Create alert. Enter an alert condition name. Make adjustments to filters as necessary. Complete the remaining alert fields (see Create alert conditions). Filter set logic When you create a filter set, you generate a list of attributes and/or tags that narrow the results. This section explains how filter sets apply various rules to the list. Inclusion and exclusion As part of building a filter set, you designate whether a filter should include or exclude entities that match certain values. The way the inclusion or exclusion works depends on how you select values: Recommended: Select values by matching a string You can generate a list of values by entering a string that you want values to match. This is useful for matching multiple values. Tip String matching efficiently generates a list of values, and this approach scales as you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with string matching: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator LIKE, which means the results include any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term East-, and all entities that contain that term are returned. Exclude If you click Exclude and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator NOT LIKE, which means the results exclude any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term West-, and all entities that do not contain that term are returned. Select values individually You can click through the list of attributes/tags to identify individual values. Tip This approach does not scale well if you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with individual value selection: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then click specific values, the filter uses the comparator IN, which means the filter looks for entities that exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. Exclude If you click Exclude and then click specific values, the filter set uses the comparator NOT IN, which means the filter returns all entities that do not exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. And/Or Filter sets use the logical operators AND and OR behind the scenes to join the data. Here are the rules for AND and OR: When you click values from multiple attributes or tags, they are joined by AND. When you click values from within an attribute or tags, they are joined by OR. The filter results display hosts for which both of the following are true: Hosts containing any one of the selected infrastructure agent versions Hosts in any one of the selected AWS availability zones",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are monitoring a filter set and notice a problem, you do not need to recreate those criteria from New Relic Alerts. Instead, you can immediately select your filter set and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you are viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment. Any alert violations will be created per entity within the filter set. Create alert conditions for infrastructure Alert conditions apply to alert policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to use other types of notification channels, create a new policy from within the Alerts UI. Important The Infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit. To add an infrastructure alert condition to an alerts policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, then select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Type a meaningful condition name. Select the Alert type, or refer to the examples to decide which type to select. Create individual filters, or copy all the filters from a filter set to identify the hosts that you want the alert condition to use. Important For more information about the rules behind filters, see Filter set logic. Define the Critical (required) and Warning (optional, if available) thresholds for triggering the alert notification. Optional: To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the Enabled checkbox option. Select an existing policy for the new condition. OR Select the option to create a new policy and identify the email for alert notifications. Optional: Add a runbook url. Optional: Set Violation time limit for violations (this defaults to 24 hours). Select Create. Important If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a \"silent attribute,\" and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the API to create alert conditions for silent attributes. Other infrastructure alert condition methods You can also use these other methods to create an infrastructure alert condition: Use the Alerts UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Alerts > Alert policies > New alert policy > Create new condition, then select Infrastructure as the product. Use the Infrastructure UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Use infrastructure settings for integrations Tip Use this method to create an alert condition for infrastructure integrations. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts, and then click Create alert condition. Name and describe the alert condition. Click the Integrations alert type, and then select the integration data source you'd like to use. Use the Filter entities dropdown to limit your condition to specific attributes. Use the Define thresholds dropdowns to define your condition's thresholds, and then click Create. The configuration settings are optional. You can always update them later. View host alert events Anyone included in the policy's notification channels receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view Infrastructure alert incidents and individual violations through the user interface. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. To change the hosts or time frame, use the search window, Filter set, or Time functions. From the Events list, select the alert violation. To view detailed information in Alerts about the selected violation, select the link. Update or delete host alert information To edit, disable (or re-enable), or delete host alert information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Use the search window or Select all checkbox to locate one or more alert conditions. Select any of the available functions to edit, disable, enable, or delete the selected conditions. Use New Relic Alerts to monitor your entire infrastructure New Relic Alerts provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across all of your New Relic products. This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities that you care about the most, such as Docker containers, JVMs, and more. Alert features Features in Infrastructure Alert conditions Create: Use the Infrastructure UI. View, change, disable (or re-enable), or delete: Use the Infrastructure Settings > Alerts UI. Information on alerts View summary information about events: Use the Infrastructure Events UI. View detailed information about alert incidents or individual violations: Use the Alerts UI or the notification channel integrated with the associated policy. Alert policies View, add, change, disable, or delete: For policies with a variety of notification channels: Use the Alerts UI. For policies only needing email notifications: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Create a new policy, and add one or more email addresses as needed. Add host conditions to an existing policy: Use the Infrastructure UI. Notification channels To view, add, change, or delete available notification options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Search for the condition or policy name. From the list of conditions, select the policy link to view notification channel information in the Alerts UI. Add a description The use of the Description field is available for these alert condition types: NRQL conditions: add a description using the NerdGraph API. Infrastructure conditions: add a description using the UI or the REST API. The text you place in an alert condition's Description field is passed downstream to associated violations and notifications. A description can be used for several purposes, including: Capturing the reason for the alert condition. Defining the signal being monitored. Defining next steps. Add metadata to downstream systems. You can use template substitution to insert values from the attributes in the associated violation event. The template format is {{attributeName}}. For the attributes you can use when creating a description, see Violation event attributes. One available attribute is the special {{tag.*}} attribute. This attribute prefix is used to access any of the tag values that are included with the target signal, or any of the entity tags that are associated with the target signal. If there are entity tags associated with your violation, then they can be accessed using the entity tag name. An example of this would be {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}. When entity tags are available to use, you see them included with the violation, and displayed when you view the violations in an incident. This field has a maximum character size of 4,000. Add or edit a runbook URL The alert condition creation process includes an option for setting a URL for runbook instructions. This lets you link to information or standard procedures for handling a violation. Before adding or updating the link, make sure you use a valid URL. To add, update, or delete an alert condition's runbook URL: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the Runbook URL link. Save the condition. In order to be saved, the URL must be a valid URL. Violation time limit for violations The violation time limit allows you to define a time period after which violations will be force-closed. By default, violation time limit is 24 hours. To add or update an alert condition's violation time limit: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the violation time limit. Save the condition. Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and NRQL queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex NRQL query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed. To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example: Problem Solution Hosts If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts. Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting prod-host-01, prod-host-02, and prod-host-03, just target all hosts with prod-host-0 in the name. Entities Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target. Create custom attributes for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. The no_trigger_on field is optional. When set to [\"shutdown\"] this enables the Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown infrastructure condition option. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12, \"no_trigger_on\": [\"shutdown\"] } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: All conditions: 24 hours When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are monitoring a filter set and notice a problem, you do not need to recreate those criteria from New Relic Alerts. Instead, you can immediately select your filter set and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you are viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment. Any alert violations will be created per entity within the filter set. Create alert conditions for infrastructure Alert conditions apply to alert policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to use other types of notification channels, create a new policy from within the Alerts UI. Important The Infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit. To add an infrastructure alert condition to an alerts policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, then select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Type a meaningful condition name. Select the Alert type, or refer to the examples to decide which type to select. Create individual filters, or copy all the filters from a filter set to identify the hosts that you want the alert condition to use. Important For more information about the rules behind filters, see Filter set logic. Define the Critical (required) and Warning (optional, if available) thresholds for triggering the alert notification. Optional: To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the Enabled checkbox option. Select an existing policy for the new condition. OR Select the option to create a new policy and identify the email for alert notifications. Optional: Add a runbook url. Optional: Set Violation time limit for violations (this defaults to 24 hours). Select Create. Important If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a \"silent attribute,\" and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the API to create alert conditions for silent attributes. Other infrastructure alert condition methods You can also use these other methods to create an infrastructure alert condition: Use the Alerts UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Alerts > Alert policies > New alert policy > Create new condition, then select Infrastructure as the product. Use the Infrastructure UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Use infrastructure settings for integrations Tip Use this method to create an alert condition for infrastructure integrations. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts, and then click Create alert condition. Name and describe the alert condition. Click the Integrations alert type, and then select the integration data source you'd like to use. Use the Filter entities dropdown to limit your condition to specific attributes. Use the Define thresholds dropdowns to define your condition's thresholds, and then click Create. The configuration settings are optional. You can always update them later. View host alert events Anyone included in the policy's notification channels receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view Infrastructure alert incidents and individual violations through the user interface. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. To change the hosts or time frame, use the search window, Filter set, or Time functions. From the Events list, select the alert violation. To view detailed information in Alerts about the selected violation, select the link. Update or delete host alert information To edit, disable (or re-enable), or delete host alert information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Use the search window or Select all checkbox to locate one or more alert conditions. Select any of the available functions to edit, disable, enable, or delete the selected conditions. Use New Relic Alerts to monitor your entire infrastructure New Relic Alerts provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across all of your New Relic products. This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities that you care about the most, such as Docker containers, JVMs, and more. Alert features Features in Infrastructure Alert conditions Create: Use the Infrastructure UI. View, change, disable (or re-enable), or delete: Use the Infrastructure Settings > Alerts UI. Information on alerts View summary information about events: Use the Infrastructure Events UI. View detailed information about alert incidents or individual violations: Use the Alerts UI or the notification channel integrated with the associated policy. Alert policies View, add, change, disable, or delete: For policies with a variety of notification channels: Use the Alerts UI. For policies only needing email notifications: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Create a new policy, and add one or more email addresses as needed. Add host conditions to an existing policy: Use the Infrastructure UI. Notification channels To view, add, change, or delete available notification options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Search for the condition or policy name. From the list of conditions, select the policy link to view notification channel information in the Alerts UI. Add a description The use of the Description field is available for these alert condition types: NRQL conditions: add a description using the NerdGraph API. Infrastructure conditions: add a description using the UI or the REST API. The text you place in an alert condition's Description field is passed downstream to associated violations and notifications. A description can be used for several purposes, including: Capturing the reason for the alert condition. Defining the signal being monitored. Defining next steps. Add metadata to downstream systems. You can use template substitution to insert values from the attributes in the associated violation event. The template format is {{attributeName}}. For the attributes you can use when creating a description, see Violation event attributes. One available attribute is the special {{tag.*}} attribute. This attribute prefix is used to access any of the tag values that are included with the target signal, or any of the entity tags that are associated with the target signal. If there are entity tags associated with your violation, then they can be accessed using the entity tag name. An example of this would be {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}. When entity tags are available to use, you see them included with the violation, and displayed when you view the violations in an incident. This field has a maximum character size of 4,000. Add or edit a runbook URL The alert condition creation process includes an option for setting a URL for runbook instructions. This lets you link to information or standard procedures for handling a violation. Before adding or updating the link, make sure you use a valid URL. To add, update, or delete an alert condition's runbook URL: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the Runbook URL link. Save the condition. In order to be saved, the URL must be a valid URL. Violation time limit for violations The violation time limit allows you to define a time period after which violations will be force-closed. By default, violation time limit is 24 hours. To add or update an alert condition's violation time limit: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the violation time limit. Save the condition. Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and NRQL queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex NRQL query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed. To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example: Problem Solution Hosts If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts. Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting prod-host-01, prod-host-02, and prod-host-03, just target all hosts with prod-host-0 in the name. Entities Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target. Create custom attributes for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. The no_trigger_on field is optional. When set to [\"shutdown\"] this enables the Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown infrastructure condition option. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12, \"no_trigger_on\": [\"shutdown\"] } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: All conditions: 24 hours When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. The no_trigger_on field is optional. When set to [\"shutdown\"] this enables the Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown infrastructure condition option. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12, \"no_trigger_on\": [\"shutdown\"] } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: All conditions: 24 hours When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process is running too many instances on one host This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences.

The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are monitoring a filter set and notice a problem, you do not need to recreate those criteria from New Relic Alerts. Instead, you can immediately select your filter set and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you are viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment. Any alert violations will be created per entity within the filter set. Create alert conditions for infrastructure Alert conditions apply to alert policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to use other types of notification channels, create a new policy from within the Alerts UI. Important The Infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit. To add an infrastructure alert condition to an alerts policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, then select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Type a meaningful condition name. Select the Alert type, or refer to the examples to decide which type to select. Create individual filters, or copy all the filters from a filter set to identify the hosts that you want the alert condition to use. Important For more information about the rules behind filters, see Filter set logic. Define the Critical (required) and Warning (optional, if available) thresholds for triggering the alert notification. Optional: To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the Enabled checkbox option. Select an existing policy for the new condition. OR Select the option to create a new policy and identify the email for alert notifications. Optional: Add a runbook url. Optional: Set Violation time limit for violations (this defaults to 24 hours). Select Create. Important If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a \"silent attribute,\" and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the API to create alert conditions for silent attributes. Other infrastructure alert condition methods You can also use these other methods to create an infrastructure alert condition: Use the Alerts UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Alerts > Alert policies > New alert policy > Create new condition, then select Infrastructure as the product. Use the Infrastructure UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Use infrastructure settings for integrations Tip Use this method to create an alert condition for infrastructure integrations. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts, and then click Create alert condition. Name and describe the alert condition. Click the Integrations alert type, and then select the integration data source you'd like to use. Use the Filter entities dropdown to limit your condition to specific attributes. Use the Define thresholds dropdowns to define your condition's thresholds, and then click Create. The configuration settings are optional. You can always update them later. View host alert events Anyone included in the policy's notification channels receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view Infrastructure alert incidents and individual violations through the user interface. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. To change the hosts or time frame, use the search window, Filter set, or Time functions. From the Events list, select the alert violation. To view detailed information in Alerts about the selected violation, select the link. Update or delete host alert information To edit, disable (or re-enable), or delete host alert information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Use the search window or Select all checkbox to locate one or more alert conditions. Select any of the available functions to edit, disable, enable, or delete the selected conditions. Use New Relic Alerts to monitor your entire infrastructure New Relic Alerts provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across all of your New Relic products. This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities that you care about the most, such as Docker containers, JVMs, and more. Alert features Features in Infrastructure Alert conditions Create: Use the Infrastructure UI. View, change, disable (or re-enable), or delete: Use the Infrastructure Settings > Alerts UI. Information on alerts View summary information about events: Use the Infrastructure Events UI. View detailed information about alert incidents or individual violations: Use the Alerts UI or the notification channel integrated with the associated policy. Alert policies View, add, change, disable, or delete: For policies with a variety of notification channels: Use the Alerts UI. For policies only needing email notifications: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Create a new policy, and add one or more email addresses as needed. Add host conditions to an existing policy: Use the Infrastructure UI. Notification channels To view, add, change, or delete available notification options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Search for the condition or policy name. From the list of conditions, select the policy link to view notification channel information in the Alerts UI. Add a description The use of the Description field is available for these alert condition types: NRQL conditions: add a description using the NerdGraph API. Infrastructure conditions: add a description using the UI or the REST API. The text you place in an alert condition's Description field is passed downstream to associated violations and notifications. A description can be used for several purposes, including: Capturing the reason for the alert condition. Defining the signal being monitored. Defining next steps. Add metadata to downstream systems. You can use template substitution to insert values from the attributes in the associated violation event. The template format is {{attributeName}}. For the attributes you can use when creating a description, see Violation event attributes. One available attribute is the special {{tag.*}} attribute. This attribute prefix is used to access any of the tag values that are included with the target signal, or any of the entity tags that are associated with the target signal. If there are entity tags associated with your violation, then they can be accessed using the entity tag name. An example of this would be {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}. When entity tags are available to use, you see them included with the violation, and displayed when you view the violations in an incident. This field has a maximum character size of 4,000. Add or edit a runbook URL The alert condition creation process includes an option for setting a URL for runbook instructions. This lets you link to information or standard procedures for handling a violation. Before adding or updating the link, make sure you use a valid URL. To add, update, or delete an alert condition's runbook URL: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the Runbook URL link. Save the condition. In order to be saved, the URL must be a valid URL. Violation time limit for violations The violation time limit allows you to define a time period after which violations will be force-closed. By default, violation time limit is 24 hours. To add or update an alert condition's violation time limit: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the violation time limit. Save the condition. Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and NRQL queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex NRQL query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed. To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example: Problem Solution Hosts If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts. Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting prod-host-01, prod-host-02, and prod-host-03, just target all hosts with prod-host-0 in the name. Entities Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target. Create custom attributes for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.

This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process is running too many instances on one host This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition.

Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range.

Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events.

Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation.

View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this...

Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (e.g. newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz) maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is logged. Once an error has been logged, the cached debug messages are logged, but only the most recent number of configured debug messages. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, after an error is logged, only the 10 most recent debug messages are logged, and older logs are discarded. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports.

If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance.

Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Map Prometheus and New Relic metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Set allow or deny lists for sent metrics If you need greater control over the data you send to New Relic, you can send a subset of your metrics. To do this, configure remote-write with the write_relabel_configs parameter with a subparameter action value of keep or deny. In this example, you'll only send the metrics that match the regular expression. Unmatched metrics won't be sent. Alternatively, you can use action: drop to drop all of the metrics that match the regular expression. - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy This Kubernetes example uses this Helm chart's values.yaml file. If you're using a different Helm chart, please check its remoteWrite documentation (for example, some Helm files use camelcase writeRelabelConfigs instead). remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below. Prometheus remote write integration Benefits: Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Reminders: You will need to manage your Prometheus servers. You can reduce your storage retention. Fewer query loads to the server. Recommendations: Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits: Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers Store all your metrics directly in New Relic No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. No need for local storage. Reminders: Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. New Relic's database can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube.

Solution When running the integration in a huge cluster scraping hundreds of targets, CPU and memory consumption will increase, and the number of workers could affect scrape_duration. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Map Prometheus and New Relic metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Set allow or deny lists for sent metrics If you need greater control over the data you send to New Relic, you can send a subset of your metrics. To do this, configure remote-write with the write_relabel_configs parameter with a subparameter action value of keep or deny. In this example, you'll only send the metrics that match the regular expression. Unmatched metrics won't be sent. Alternatively, you can use action: drop to drop all of the metrics that match the regular expression. - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy This Kubernetes example uses this Helm chart's values.yaml file. If you're using a different Helm chart, please check its remoteWrite documentation (for example, some Helm files use camelcase writeRelabelConfigs instead). remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: \"coredns_(.*)|etcd_(.*)\" action: keep Copy Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image. Decrease worker_threads from the default value of 4 to your preferred value.",

The transformations are executed in the following order: Ignore metrics. Add or include attributes. Rename attributes. Copy attributes. Important Avoid sending Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data that is not relevant to your monitoring needs. Instead, use filters to ignore or include specific metrics. This will help you control the amount and types of data you send to New Relic. This will also help you avoid additional billing charges. For more information, see Ignore or include Prometheus metrics. Example configuration To use these options, set up the scraper container configuration file (config.yaml in the current directory): docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy Here is an example configuration file containing all of these examples: transformations: - description: \"Transformation for MySQL exporter\" add_attributes: - metric_prefix: \"mysql_\" attributes: owningTeam: \"database-team\" rename_attributes: - metric_prefix: \"mysql_\" attributes: table: \"tableName\" under_score: \"CamelCase\" copy_attributes: - from_metric: \"mysql_version_info\" to_metrics: - \"mysql_\" attributes: - \"innodb_version\" - \"version\" ignore_metrics: - prefixes: - \"go_\" - \"process_\" Copy Add attributes This transformation allows you to include a set of statically defined attributes to a set of target metrics.

It can be helpful to have this attribute on all metrics for that service. This transformation allows you to copy attributes from a source metric to a set of target metrics. Important You can only copy attributes between metrics in the same endpoint.

This will help you control the amount and types of data you send to New Relic. This will also help you avoid additional billing charges, as explained in this document. Prevent billing increases We use the Prometheus discovery and scrape annotations. If you set the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to scrape all the available targets and to send all the data that's exposed from those targets, you may exceed New Relic's platform limits and increase your billing charges. To help prevent this from happening, use the integration's filtering capabilities. For more information, see the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration requirements for Docker and Kubernetes. Also see the troubleshooting procedures for NrIntegrationError events. Identify metrics to ignore or include To decide what data to include or exclude, use New Relic's Metric API to explore your metric data. Then, refine your filters to scrape only relevant targets and send useful metrics. To filter out unwanted metrics from a target, use the ignore_metrics configuration option. To filter out targets instead of the metrics, use the scrape_enabled_label configuration option. The nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map showing an example configuration. The integration will ignore or include metrics before executing the other functions to add, rename, or copy attributes. Filter out unwanted metrics (ignore) To ignore unwanted metrics, use the following transformation. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics that start with go_ or process_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - prefixes: - \"go_\" - \"process_\" Copy Example: Input go_goroutines 13 process_virtual_memory_bytes 2.062336e+07 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy This is taken from the MySQL exporter. Besides the MySQL metrics, it also exposes metrics about the exporter that may not be of interest to you. Example: Output mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy Include only specific metrics (except) If you only want to include specific metrics, you can use the except list under the ignore_metrics section. As the name implies, this will ignore all the metrics except the ones that contain the with the given prefixes. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics except kube_hpa_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - except: - kube_hpa_ Copy",

The nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map showing an example configuration. The integration will ignore or include metrics before executing the other functions to add, rename, or copy attributes. Filter out unwanted metrics (ignore) To ignore unwanted metrics, use the following transformation. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics that start with go_ or process_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - prefixes: - \"go_\" - \"process_\" Copy Example: Input go_goroutines 13 process_virtual_memory_bytes 2.062336e+07 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy This is taken from the MySQL exporter. Besides the MySQL metrics, it also exposes metrics about the exporter that may not be of interest to you. Example: Output mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_close\"} 0 mysql_global_status_commands_total{command=\"ha_open\"} 0 Copy Include only specific metrics (except) If you only want to include specific metrics, you can use the except list under the ignore_metrics section. As the name implies, this will ignore all the metrics except the ones that contain the with the given prefixes. Example: Configuration To drop all metrics except kube_hpa_: transformations: - description: \"General processing rules\" ignore_metrics: - except: - kube_hpa_ Copy",
