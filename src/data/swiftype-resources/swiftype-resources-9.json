      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet, also referred to as an \"agent,\" to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Enable browser monitoring Browser Pro+SPA is the default agent when you enable browser monitoring. This automatically gives you access to all of our browser monitoring features. For more information about the browser monitoring options, see Browser agent types in this document. To enable browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. Follow the instructions in the UI to add browser monitoring to your app. Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic. Optional: After installation is complete and you are seeing data, go to the App settings page for additional agent configuration, or to change the browser agent type. It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If have problems, follow our troubleshooting tips. Deployment options No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is the same: the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet (also referred to as the \"agent\") is inserted into your app pages. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. Enable an APM-monitored app When enabling browser monitoring, you can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that's already being monitored by APM. APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index. Enable with copy/paste When enabling browser monitoring, you can manually insert the JavaScript snippet into your app's webpages. The copy/paste option gives you control over the exact placement of our JavaScript snippet, which is required to monitor the webpage's performance. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Some tips for using the JavaScript snippet: Placement in your webpage: Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. License key and app ID: Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. Our APM agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you are using an APM agent's API to manually add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Use REST API This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser monitoring UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing. Browser agent type Comparison Pro+SPA This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring. What it includes: Gives you access to all of the Browser Pro features and to Single Page App (SPA) monitoring. Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including distributed tracing, for all types of applications. Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring. Pro What it includes: Gives you access to the Browser Pro features. What it doesn't include: Lacks the functionality designed for single page app monitoring. Lite What it includes: Gives you information about some basic page load timing and browser user information. What it doesn't include: Lacks the Browser Pro features and SPA features. Details about how agent types relate to pricing: New Relic One pricing: This pricing plan has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install. Original pricing: Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent. After initial agent installation is finished, you can go to the App settings page to edit your configuration or to change your subscription.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started. Percentile over timeseries Show the 95th percentile of first paint and first contentful paint over a time series: SELECT FILTER(percentile(firstPaint, 95), where(timingName = ' firstPaint ')) as 'fp', FILTER(percentile( firstContentfulPaint , 95), where(timingName = 'firstContentfulPaint')) as 'fcp' FROM PageViewTiming TIMESERIES 1 minute SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Percentile by transaction and interaction Show the 95th percentile of first input delay over a time series, faceted by transaction name and interaction type: SELECT percentile( firstInputDelay , 95) as 'fid' FROM PageViewTiming WHERE timingName = 'firstInteraction' TIMESERIES 1 minute FACET browserTransactionName, interactionType SINCE 3 hours ago Copy Histogram of delay timings Show a histogram of first input delay timings faceted by first interaction time ranges: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT histogram( firstInputDelay , 1000, 10) SINCE 3 hours ago WHERE timingName = 'firstInteraction' FACET CASES (WHERE firstInteraction < 1, WHERE firstInteraction >= 1 AND firstInteraction < 5, WHERE firstInteraction >= 5) Copy",

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life. Query your event data Here are some sample queries for the event data to help you get started.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API.

CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache.

      "body": "Browser monitoring's PageViewTiming event sends each data point as a separate event as soon as it is available. Because we do not restrict the timing, you can receive first paint or first interaction data regardless of when it fires. This document describes why and how to use PageViewTiming and its attributes to query data about your site, component loading, and user performance metrics, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Why use PageViewTiming? If your application uses asynchronous or dynamic pages, you may need additional details about site or component loading. But pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser agent. For example, users may become impatient and begin clicking as soon as content is on the webpage. Or, they may wait to use the page until long after content is loaded. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. The additional metrics can help you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Support for Google's Core Web Vitals As of agent version 1177 for browser monitoring, we have full support for Google's Core Web Vitals for 2020. The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set for 2020 focuses on three aspects of the user experience: loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This includes the following metrics and their respective thresholds: Core Web Vitals metrics include loading, interactivity, and visual stability. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1. For each of these metrics, to ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. To learn more, watch our Nerd Days talk on perceived performance. Detailed visual, interactivity, and responsiveness metrics The BrowserInteraction and PageView events end their reporting when they receive the page window load (or window load and AJAX) timing. However, paint and interactivity metrics can happen at any time. PageViewTiming delivers these metrics as a separate event to: Account for the variability in this timing. Avoid setting an arbitrary timeout. Prevent holding BrowserInteraction and PageView events indefinitely. Additional data Comments firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes already are available with BrowserInteraction and PageView events. However, they are not always reliably captured before the window onload event fires. Using PageViewTiming gives you a way to capture these metrics even if they happen after the original page load time. This gives you a better understanding of the correlation between responsiveness of that load event and the visual rendering of your content. largestContentfulPaint The largestContentfulPaint,metric is available with agent version 1163 or higher. It reports the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport. Google's research found that looking at when the largest element was rendered was a more accurate way to measure when the main content of a page is loaded and useful. For more information about this metric, including limitations and considerations, see the w3c draft. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with LCP. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Largest Contentful Paint is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. LCP values up to 2.5 secs are considered \"Good,\" between 2.5-4.0 secs are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 4.0 secs are considered \"Poor.\" firstInteraction and firstInputDelay With the addition of firstInteraction and firstInputDelay, you can quickly determine the ways that your users are interacting with that visual content. These metrics tell you not only when they interacted, but what type of interaction (mousedown, pointerdown, etc.) and how long it took for them to receive a response from your site. The firstInputDelay metric lies in the middle of FirstContentfulPaint and Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics. It measures the time between when a first input can be made and when the browser's main thread is able to respond to any interactions. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute at the moment of the user's first interaction. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. First Input Delay is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. FID values up to 100 ms are considered \"Good,\" between 100-300 ms are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 300 ms are considered \"Poor.\" For a more detailed explanation, see our browser monitoring release notes. cumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is available with agent v1177 or higher. CLS is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. This is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered \"Good,\" between 0.1-0.25 are considered \"Needs Improvement,\" and above 0.25 are considered \"Poor.\" timingName You can review different types of activities with the timingName attribute, such as firstPaint, firstContentfulPaint, firstInteraction, largestContentfulPaint, pageHide and windowUnload. For example, a PageViewTiming event may have a timingName of firstPaint and a firstPaint value of .03. The event will also include all default attributes included with the standard BrowserInteraction and PageView events. elementId This is the Id, if specified, of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. This value can be null. elementSize This is the reported size of the largestContentfulPaint element. This value will only be reported with the LCP metric. pageHide The pageHide event, available with agent v1177 or higher, is sent when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a different page from the session's history. For example, when the user clicks the browser's Back button, the current page receives a pageHide event before the previous page is shown. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the pageHide event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with pageHide. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowLoad The windowLoad event is available with agent v1177 or higher. This is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowLoad event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowLoad. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. windowUnload The windowUnload event is available with agent v1163 or higher. This is fired when a document or child resource is being unloaded. For supporting documentation and browser compatibility for the windowUnload event, see the MDN Web Docs site. We also report the cumulative layout shift (CLS) score attribute with windowUnload. This attribute is reported as cumulativeLayoutShift. Compatibility and requirements Requirements: Meets install requirements. Reporting of this event requires browser agent version 1153 or higher and a Pro or Pro+SPA agent. Follow our Browser agent release notes to find out when new metrics are released. These metrics are supported by the following browser versions. For unsupported browsers, no PageViewTiming events will be recorded. Metrics Supported browser versions cumulativeLayoutShift Chrome 79 Metric is elevated to stable; changes in metric definition will be reported in this log. Chrome 77 Metric exposed via API: Cumulative Layout Shift available via Layout Instability API firstPaint firstContentfulPaint Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile largestContentfulPaint Chrome 77 or higher for desktop and mobile firstInteraction firstInputDelay These metrics require the addEventListener browser API. This API is available in all modern browsers, including: Apple Safari Google Chrome Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher Mozilla Firefox pageHide This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowLoad This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. windowUnload This metric is currently supported by all browsers on desktop and mobile. Compatibility matrix via MDN documentation. CumulativeLayoutShift Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric measuring the stability of the content on a webpage. For a complete description, see web.dev/cls. How is CLS captured in New Relic Shifts in page layout as reported by the Layout Instability API are aggregated throughout the life of the page and reported as an attribute on all PageViewTiming events, representing the CLS value when that event occurred. Using this model, users can look at their CLS value at different points in the page's life; for example, CLS values up until the first-time users interact with the page or hide the page. Approximating other CLS sources Lighthouse captures CLS value only up to the time when a page is loaded, which is useful in a development or lab environment. You can approximate Lighthouse values by looking at the windowLoad PageViewTiming event. CrUX report uses values captured over the lifespan of the page, which is useful to analyze worst-case shifts in a RUM environment. You can approximate CrUX values by looking at the CLS attribute on the windowUnload PageViewTiming event. These values will not be exactly the same because of different sample sets and a difference in how values from long-lived web pages are included. The New Relic browser monitoring agent captures CLS when the page unloads, while CrUX collects and updates the metric throughout the lifespan of the page. How CLS is aggregated As of July 2021, Google has updated the way CLS values are aggregated. Browser monitoring agent versions v12xx use the method described in Evolving the CLS metric. Browser monitoring agent v12xx or higher: Layout shift values are captured in windows. Layout shifts that occurred within 1 second of each other, but no more than 5 seconds between the first and last shift, are part of the same window. A CLS score represents the sum of layout shift values from the window with the highest sum of layout shift values. Prior to Browser agent v12xx: A CLS score represents the sum of all layout shifts that occurred up until that point in the page's life.

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

      "body": "This document explains: How a web page loads How browser monitoring measures page load timing, also known as real user monitoring (RUM) Tip This is a description of traditional, synchronous page load timing. Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

If a user navigates from a site without page load timing to a site with page load timing (for example, to the first page on your page load timing-enabled site), special considerations for navigation start time arise. Contents Network estimate The page load timing JavaScript utility file creates a cookie with the navigation start time when a user leaves a page (by hooking an event, beforeunload, or pagehide, depending on the browser). However, when navigating away from a site without page load timing enabled, the JavaScript code will not be present, and the cookie will not be created. Then, when the user hits the first page of a site, the navigation start time cannot be determined, because there is no cookie. In this case the browser agent has all the data (queue time, app time, DOM content and rendering time) except network time. Navigation start time is required to compute network time. Rather than toss the data, the page load timing feature estimates the network time based on recently accumulated averages for your application, regionally. This way the page load timing feature provides a more accurate throughput measurement, and the rest of the data is retained. This is especially important for sites with a high bounce rate (when users visit only one page). The more visitors you have from different regions, the more accurate the network estimate will be. Network estimate unavailable If a network estimate is not available for your application and for the region where the hit originated, the page load timing process reverts to a network estimate across all reporting apps for the region. Failing that, the data is tossed. Note: For browsers that have the Navigation Timing API, this is not an issue, as the navigation start time can be determined without using a cookie.

Contents Detecting cached pages Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0. Here are some additional tips for cached pages: Java: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Node.js: By default, Node.js does not cache pages. PHP: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation. Python: Restart your app. Ruby: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the user interface, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

This JavaScript instrumentation has been designed to: Provide maximum visibility into front-end performance, accurately time how long it takes for pages to load in all browsers, and to report details for JavaScript errors and AJAX calls. Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring!

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.) For more help Additional documentation resources include: Instrumentation for page load timing (JavaScript elements, data transmission) Browser monitoring and search engine optimization (how browser ensures that the JavaScript has a negligible impact on SEO)",

      "body": "Browser monitoring provides insights into how your application or site behaves when it is loaded in a web browser. Browser only records performance data, as explained in this document. It does not record any data used or stored by the monitored application unless you explicitly configure it to do so. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Reported data Browser reports many different types of data to help you analyze your website's performance. It only reports page view data, unless you have subscribed to Pro features. You can also enable functionality for AJAX requests, JavaScript errors, and session traces. For most data types, browser transmits the data securely using HTTPS encryption. The browser agent transmits data to New Relic's collectors by using either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Here is a summary of the types of data reported by browser monitoring. Page view data This data is reported once per page view and consists of: Page load timing data Name of the server-side app controller that served the page, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the server-side app controller, if available (obfuscated in the page and during transmission) Additional custom parameters set by the browser agent API, if set prior to page load This information appears on the Page views page. For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. AJAX timing data When enabled, browser periodically reports AJAX timing data until the user navigates away from or closes the page. (New Relic automatically filters out all AJAX requests that take longer than two minutes.) Data includes: Hostnames, ports, and paths (but not search/query parameters) of AJAX request URLs HTTP status code of responses Byte size of request message bodies Name of the server-side app controller servicing the AJAX request and server-side timing data (obfuscated in the page and during transmission), when the browser instrumentation is injected by the New Relic agent Timing data for the AJAX transaction Timing data for the AJAX callbacks This information appears on the AJAX page. JavaScript error data When enabled, browser periodically reports data about every error that occurs on the page until the user navigates away from or closes the page. This information appears on the JavaScript errors page. For each error, the data includes: Exception class of the error Error message containing arbitrary text Stack trace of the error, which may contain function names and URLs of scripts causing the error Error messages typically do not contain any confidential or sensitive information. However, it is possible for messages to be purposefully constructed with sensitive information. Before enabling JavaScript error reporting, ensure that your website does not expose any sensitive information in error messages. Session trace data When enabled, browser periodically reports data on the details of the a single page's life cycle, including user interactions, AJAX loads, and JavaScript errors, until the user navigates away from or closes the page. New Relic automatically stops recording further data after ten minutes. Data includes: Asset load timing details User interactions such as scrolling, mousing, and clicking JavaScript error timing and other JavaScript error information Triggered Javascript events Session traces are captured randomly at a fixed rate from among the monitored page views. Session trace information appears on the Session traces page. SPA data If you use browser's single-page app (SPA) monitoring, New Relic reports the following data once per page load or route change. Browser data for page views, AJAX timing, JavaScript errors, and session traces Hash fragments associated with SPA route changes Additional custom parameters added from the SPA API When SPA monitoring has been enabled, this information appears on the Page views page. Server-side data can only be collected when the host is also instrumented by New Relic, and the browser monitoring instrumentation is injected by the agent. For more information about how we collect and present this data, see Instrumentation for page load timing. URL query strings The browser agent uses the HTTP referer attribute to track page URLs. URLs can sometimes contain potentially sensitive user-entered query data (for example, a user's name). For data security reasons, browser does not record or collect URL query strings. Visitor's IP address Browser uses the visitor's IP address to enrich data for additional visitor segmentation. Details such as the ASN and geoID are mapped to browser data from the IP address. For data security reasons, browser does not retain the visitor's IP address for reporting. The IP address is obtained in the HTTP header from the request to the New Relic collector. New Relic does not retain the visitor's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is overwritten within 24 hours of data being collected. Browser types Browser determines the browser type from the User-Agent header and the geographical location based on the browser's IP address. New Relic does not retain the IP address, only the country and region associated with the performance data. This information appears on the selected app's Geography page. Also, details about specific browser types appear on the selected app's Browsers page. CDN access Page load timing requires access to the content delivery network (CDN), where New Relic's utility JavaScript file (nr.js) is hosted. The domain name for the file (js-agent.newrelic.com) remains static, but the number in the path (version) may change periodically. A script tag is injected by the New Relic agent (or pasted into the webpage for standalone apps) that references the JavaScript on the CDN, which is then loaded by the browser. The loaded JavaScript collects and reports the metrics dynamically to either of the domains bam.nr-data.net or bam-cell.nr-data.net. Important If your end users are behind a firewall or proxy and do not have access to the CDN or to New Relic's networks (including bam.nr-data.net and bam-cell.nr-data.net), browser monitoring will not work. Cookies Browser monitoring creates cookies in the end user's browser. If the user has cookies disabled, page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) will not be able to track sessions properly. Also, if the user has an older browser that does not support the Navigation Timing Specification API, page load timing will not be able to track response times as accurately. New Relic's cookies generated by browser agents older than version 995 may not contain the secure attribute. This is because page load timing data transmission in versions before version 995 use HTTP when the page is HTTP, but use HTTPS when the page is HTTPS. All browser agent versions above version 995 will always use the secure flag for cookies and transmit over HTTPS. JavaScript and AJAX data may contain more sensitive information, so they are always transmitted over HTTPS. Transmission of these cookies using HTTP or access to them from JavaScript is not a significant security risk, because the cookies are not used to make security decisions or allow access to an account. They are used only to collect performance data, with any identifiable data obfuscated. For customers subject to special guidelines for cookie collection, such as those under the EU GDPR/PECR ICO Guidelines, we now provide the option to disable cookie collection for your application. Please see our browser agent v1169 release notes for more information. Important If your site uses P3P, it must be configured to allow these cookies. JSONP requests Page load timing metrics are reported to New Relic using a Script GET, also known as a JSONP request. The Script GET returns a value that is subsequently stored in a cookie and used to trigger trace capturing.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

This JavaScript instrumentation has been designed to: Provide maximum visibility into front-end performance, accurately time how long it takes for pages to load in all browsers, and to report details for JavaScript errors and AJAX calls. Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions. Troubleshooting your Node.js installation: Try these steps if you don't see any data, cannot log files, or encounter other installation problems with the Node.js agent.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.

Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions.

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

The SPA-enabled version of the agent gives access to other powerful New Relic features, like distributed tracing. For more information, see Enable browser monitoring. For compatability information for SPA-related features, see SPA requirements. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by browser monitoring includes: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.",

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies. Query and visualize your default data (or customize your own), then analyze what that data says about your business. Customize and share your own charts and dashboards.",

Single-page app (SPA) data To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Initial page loads and route changes are automatically grouped by browser interaction name. You can adjust this with your allow list settings for segments. If you set custom route names with the SPA API, the custom route names will be displayed. You can change how the page loads and route changes are grouped by using the Group page by dropdown. By default, the list of page loads and route changes displays the most time consuming views at the top of the list. You can also sort by average response time, median response time, and throughput per minute by using the Sort by dropdown. To search for specific views by grouped URL, type in the search bar below the Sort by dropdown. For example, to find URLs that represent your checkout page, search for checkout. The charts on the initial Page view page display: The five views with the slowest average response times The five views with the highest throughput To change the range of time being examined, use the time picker near the top of the page. (If you choose a time range more than eight days in the past, some filtering and grouping functionality won't be available.) Filter SPA views one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > Filter: Use the Filter to filter for route changes, initial page loads, and other attributes like location and browser type. To view only initial page loads or only route changes, use the Filter dropdown. For example, to view only route changes, select Filter > Route change. The filter also gives you the ability to filter by other attributes of page loads and route changes, such as app name, geographical location of the browser, and browser type. For example, to see only page loads and route changes that occurred on browsers in the city of Portland, Oregon, select Filter > City > Portland. Group SPA views You can use the Group page by dropdown to group the list of page views by any attribute. For example, if you want to compare the average response times by browser type, select Group page by > userAgent. The combination of filtering and grouping lets you quickly find very specific data. For example, to compare how a specific URL is loading on different browsers: From the Filter dropdown, select targetURL, then select the URL you want to study. From the Group page by dropdown, select userAgent. SPA view details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > (select a view): Select a view from the list to see assorted details and breakdowns. Select an individual page load or route change to see details. Selecting either will provide a breakdown of where time was spent for a browser interaction, and display that data over a time series matching the window selected in the time picker. Every route change view can theoretically also be an initial page load. (For example, when a route change URL is sent to someone else and they load it, that will now be considered an initial page load to New Relic.) This is why the SPA view details page has charts for both initial page loads and route changes. This allows you to compare how a view performs as an initial page load to how its performance as a route change. There are three chart display options, selectable with the icons to the right of the Avg initial page load time chart title. The default display is the color-coded stacked area chart. You can also switch to a Histogram display or a percentile line graph. Also on the details page is a Throughput chart that combines initial page loads and route changes. The chart displays the 5 pages with the highest throughput, which are listed beneath the chart, and consolidates all other pages into Other. Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line shows when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by the browser agent without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal throughout 2021 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

      "body": "This document explains how browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction.

An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data.

      "body": "This document explains how browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point.

      "body": "New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises via your preferred communication channel, like Slack. Resolve errors faster with errors from across your stack, including all APM, browser(RUM), mobile, and serverless (AWS Lambda) data, displayed on one screen. Errors are grouped to cut down on noise and collaborating across teams is easy with shared visibility to the same error data. Important Errors inbox is not available in the EU region. Why it matters Errors inbox provides a unified error tracking experience to detect and triage errors: View and triage issues across applications and services that your team cares about. Proactive notifications with detailed error information in Slack Error profiles to show similarities between error events and surface the root cause. Analyze errors in context of the full stack and resolve errors with precision. Triage and tackle errors, including APM, browser, mobile, and AWS Lambda Functions. Set up errors inbox To enable errors inbox, follow these steps below. Afterwards, errors groups should start to appear in your inbox. From one.newrelic.com select More in the top right and click Errors inbox from the dropdown. If this is your first time accessing errors inbox, you will be prompted to select a workload in the top left. Once you select your workload, your inbox should populate with error groups. If you have no workloads set up, you will need to create one before you can use errors inbox. one.newrelic.com > More > Errors inbox Errors groups Error groups are sets of events that make up a unique error. Error groups are stored long term and contain metrics, activity log, discussions, and basic information about the unique error. Error groups are tied to the entity, making a change to the state of an error group in one errors inbox will impact all other inboxes that contain that entity. How error groups work Error events get grouped into an error group when they share the same fingerprint. As events are ingested by New Relic, we run the events through a set of managed rules that output a fingerprint. Every unique fingerprint has a single error group associated with it. The New Relic managed rules normalize the error data, identifying and ignoring unique values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses, etc. that would cause grouping “like” errors into unique groups. NR account ID, Entity ID, Error Class, message, and stack traces and exceptions are data that can impact a fingerprint. Troubleshooting: similar looking events do not group together If you see “like” error events grouped into different error groups incorrectly, try removing the unique identifier from the error class or message and store those as attributes instead. This will allow you to more easily facet on the attribute values and reduce the number of error groups. If you have a single application reporting as multiple entities in New Relic (i.e. running in different clusters, cells, etc), you might see duplicate error groups, since our grouping logic looks at account and entity IDs as part of the fingerprinting process. You can consider rolling up the multiple entities into a single entity and including only that rolled up entity as part of your errors inbox. You can also use the feedback tool in NR1 to share error groups that could use improved grouping. We’re continually updating our rules to improve the quality of error groups. Triage errors Statuses Errors inbox enables you to triage error groups right from the main screen or from the error details page. Triaging helps remove the noise from your errors inbox, and let’s you focus on the high impact errors that need attention. You can set one of three statuses, and filter your inbox by status. Unresolved: This is the default status of error groups. Resolved: Setting an error as resolved will hide it from the default inbox view unless filters are updated to include resolved errors. If events matching the error group fingerprint occur after marking an error group as resolved, it will automatically unresolve. This can be useful for identifying regressions. Ignored: Ignored will hide the error group from the inbox view unless filters are updated to include ignored errors, or until you stop ignoring the error group. Assign errors You can assign an error group to anyone. Simply select the user from the assign dropdown menu. You may also assign an error to any email address, even if they aren’t a New Relic user. You can update the filter in errors inbox to show only errors assigned to yourself, or a teammate. Currently assigning an error group to a user does not send a notification. Notifications of assignment and changes to error groups will be coming soon. Monitor your errors Once you've set up your errors inbox, you can begin proactively monitoring all errors in your stack: Error groups: Your errors inbox automatically groups your errors so you can easily review all the unique errors within your system. Occurrences: Your errors inbox displays the total number of occurrences of each errors within the selected timeframe. The corresponding sparkline chart displays the total number of occurrences per day over the selected timeframe. Status: You can set the status of an error by selecting the dropdown and choosing either Unresolved, Resolve, or Ignore. You can ignore errors to reduce noise, leave it unresolved, or proactively resolve the error. Assign errors: Assign errors directly to individuals. Sort by: You can sort the list of grouped errors by number of occurrences or by the error that was last seen (latest first). Error details Clicking on a specific error group takes you to the error details page, where you will find full context of the issue. This context can assist in triaging the error and assigning it to the correct team or individual. Occurrences The occurrences page includes details like: Related account Stack trace Logs in context Error attributes Number and frequency of occurrences The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance in-between. Attributes The Attributes tab enables you to quickly find commonalities between the related errors for faster resolution. Click on a specific attribute to open a sidebar with specific details. Activity Displays a log of the status changes and user assignments of an error group. Discussions The discussions provides room for detailed and organized collaboration. This is key to looping in collaborators and ensuring the entire team has the same context regardless of where they sit. Discussions includes: Threaded conversations: Reply directly to top level comments to tie replies to specific posts. Comment deletion: Delete comments. The content of the post will be removed, but the box will remain with the message “comment deleted.” Markdown support: Add styling and links to your comments in Markdown. Connect an inbox to Slack Each inbox can be connected to a specific workspace and channel in Slack. To set this up, follow the steps below. If your Slack workspace does not have the New Relic app installed, do that first. From an inbox, select the Inbox Settings icon (looks like a gear) in the top right corner. Toggle the Slack button to \"on\" if it is \"off\". If no workspaces are available, click the \"+\" button to enable Slack with a one click Slack authentication. Once authenticated, you will be able to select a Workspace and specific Channel to send notifications to. Click \"Test\" to ensure messages are being sent to the right channel. Connect errors inbox to CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. Once set up, you can jump from an error group directly to the offending code in your IDE by clicking the Open in IDE button. Learn more here.",

      "body": "NOTE #1: Recent versions of Jira Server (>=8.14.0) support the use of API Tokens to access the Jira Server REST API. We recommend you use API Tokens if possible to avoid the more complicated setup described here. Check your Jira Server version. NOTE #2: You must be a Jira administrator in order to configure this integration. To determine if you have the proper permissions in order to proceed, look for the Jira Settings menu (cog icon, mostly likely at the top-right next to your headshot) and make sure there's an \"Applications\" option there. If you don't have the Settings menu, or the Applications option, then you won't be able to configure the integration. NOTE #3: This integration requires that your Jira Server instance be at a publicly accessible URL. CodeStream can integrate with Jira Server using Atlassian’s published REST API. To enable CodeStream to integrate with your Jira Server installation, you will need to set up a CodeStream application link. This application link serves as a conduit for users to authenticate against their Jira Server account without ever having to enter their credentials in CodeStream. Jira Server uses the OAuth standard (version 1.0a) for client authorization. For reference, this page from Atlassian describes the process: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/. However, you do not need to follow the full instructions on that page; the relevant instructions are duplicated and simplified here for clarity. Note that you will need the openssl command-line tool to generate a public/private key pair for use with the application link. Generate a public/private key pair In a terminal, use openssl to generate your public/private key pair, following these steps carefully: Generate a 1024-bit private key: openssl genrsa -out jira_privatekey.pem 1024 Create an X509 certificate: openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -key jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_publickey.cer -days 365 Enter whatever information you see fit to accompany the certificate. Extract the private key (PKCS8 format) to the jira_privatekey.pcks8 file: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_privatekey.pcks8 Extract the public key from the certificate to the jira_publickey.pem file: openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in jira_publickey.cer > jira_publickey.pem Create an application link Follow these steps to create your application link within Jira Server. In Jira, navigate to Jira settings (gear icon in upper-right), select Applications. Type in your Administrator password if needed. Then select Application links under \"Integrations\", in the left sidebar. Where it says Enter the URL of the application you want to link, enter any URL you want, for example, http://example.com/. Then click Create new link. You will likely see a warning starting with: No response was received from the URL you entered. You can ignore the warning; click Continue. Fill out the form as you see here, or as you like. None of the data entered here really matters, except to make sure that Create incoming link is checked. The Application Name can be whatever name works best for you to identify the link. Then click Continue. On the next dialog, enter any unique string you want for the Consumer Key. It does not need to be secure or encoded, just something fairly easy to remember. Make a note of what you enter here; it will be needed when you go to set up the integration with Jira Server from CodeStream. For Consumer Name, you can enter anything meaningful to you, like \"CodeStream app\". The important field to fill out correctly is Public Key; for this you will want to copy the full text of the contents of the jira_publickey.pem file you created in Step #1. Paste this into the Public Key field, then click Continue. The application link you created should now show like this: Set up the integration in CodeStream Now you are ready to set up the integration from CodeStream to Jira Server for your team, using the application link you just created. Assuming you have signed up for CodeStream and have the extension open in your IDE: In CodeStream, go to the Integrations panel by clicking the menu next to your username in the top-left. Then click Jira Server under \"Issue Providers\". Since you will not be using API Tokens with your Jira Server integration, you'll need to click at the top where it says \"Click here if you organization uses a version of Jira Server older than...\" to configure Jira Server using the OAuth method described herein. Fill out the form as follows. For Jira Server Base URL, enter the URL used to access your Jira Server installation as known to your internal network, in the form http(s)://host:port. For Consumer Key, use the \"consumer key\" you entered when created the application link, from Step #2, above. Then copy the full contents of the private key, in PCKS8 format, that you created in Step #1 above. The file should be called jira_privatekey.pcks8. Paste those contents into the Private Key field, then click Submit. You'll then be taken to your Jira Server instance, where you'll approve access to your account using the application link. When you are finished, return to your IDE and you should see something similar to this: Now that the integration has been set up for your organization, other users will NOT have to go through the process described above. Other users in your organization will see the integration with your Jira Server (specified by host) alongside other available integrations. Initiating this integration will only require your other users to allow the CodeStream application link to access their account, as you did in the final step.",

      "body": "Managing People & Roles Select \"My Organization\" from the My Organization menu at the top of the CodeStream pane to invite people to the organization and assign or remove admin privileges. Select \"Blame Map\" to define code ownership with your organization. By default, when you comment on code, CodeStream mentions (or offers to email) the author(s) of the code you are commenting on. But if that person has left the company it might not be the right thing to do. Note that non-admins are able to set up blame maps for themselves to handle situations where the email address they use to commit code is different than the one they used to sign up for CodeStream. Organization Settings If you are an organization admin, look for the Organization Admin menu under the headshot menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Onboarding Settings Domain-based joining allows anyone with email addresses on the specified domains to join your CodeStream organization without being first invited. Not only does this make it very easy to get your teammates on board, but it ensures that they'll be part of your organization (as opposed to accidentally creating their own). Feedback Request Assignment & Approval Admins can control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for the organization. By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the organization. Any reviewer can approve - Any one can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers are assigned. All reviewers must approve individually - Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved. You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. Round-robin will cycle through all developers in the organization. Random will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The Authorship options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch. Change Organization Name Update the name of your CodeStream organization at any time. Data Export A lightweight export facility for getting your organization's discussions out of CodeStream.

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

      "body": "When you post a message with a code block you may encounter one of the following Git-related warnings. Repo isn’t managed by Git, or Git can't be found While technically not a requirement, key elements of CodeStream’s functionality depend on your repository being managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub. If you’re not using Git, CodeStream will not be able to connect the comments and issues you create to the appropriate blocks of code in your source files. This means that comments and issues will appear in the activity feed and in search results, but they will not appear in the Codemarks section when your teammates are viewing the given source file. Note that this error could also mean that Git isn’t in your PATH. If so, please add it to your PATH and then restart your IDE. Repo doesn’t have a remote URL The remote URL is part of what allows CodeStream to tie the code block from your message to the appropriate file/location in the corresponding repo in your teammates’ IDEs. If CodeStream isn't able to identify the repository your teammate has open as the same one in which you created your comment/issue, they won't be able to see the comment/issue. From the command line, do a git remote -v to confirm whether or not you have a remote URL configured for this repository. If there is no remote URL, find out the correct URL and then specify the remote by doing a git remote add origin <remote URL>.

      "body": "CodeStream's Feedback Requests are powerful enough to use for traditional end-of-cycle code reviews, but at the same time they're so easy and flexible that you can use them throughout the development process to get quick feedback on your work in progress. Even if you haven't committed your changes! Traditional code review happens at the end of the development cycle, when you’re looking to get the changes merged. Not only are end-of-cycle code reviews much more burdensome on your teammates, but you run the risk of identifying issues so late in the game that you end up having to decide between blowing up your schedule or taking on technical debt. Whether you’re at the very beginning of a project, with just some stubbed out functions, are mid-way through a work in progress, or are ready for a final review of a finished project, CodeStream allows you to get feedback at any point during the development cycle. CodeStream handles the complexity of sharing your current status, including pushed commits, local commits, and staged and saved changes. Teammates can provide feedback right from their IDE, with no need to switch applications, and no need to switch branches or pull changes. By the time you get to that formal code review/pull request at the end of the development cycle, it’s far less painful and more of a formality because issues have been raised, discussed and resolved all along the way. Requesting feedback Request feedback at any time, regardless of the current state of your work, by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Feedback Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ r, or ctrl+/ r on a Mac). With a single click you can name the feedback request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. CodeStream assumes that you are requesting feedback on changes in the repo/branch of the file currently selected in your editor. If you have multiple repositories open in your IDE, you can change this via the repo dropdown at the very top of the form. Depending on your organization's settings, CodeStream may suggest some reviewers. Based on the commit history of the code being changed, the suggestions may even include someone that isn't yet on your CodeStream team (in which case they'd be notified via email). Hover over a reviewer’s name to see more details or to remove them. If multiple reviewers are assigned you may also have the option to determine whether any of them can approve the review, or if each one has to approve it individually. The Changed Files section lists all of the files that have been added, removed or modified. Click on any file to view a diff if you want to review your changes before submitting the feedback request. If you have a file that’s not suitable for review, such as a checked-in binary file, you can hover over any file and click the \"x\" to exclude that file from the feedback request. That file will be moved to a list below the form. Note that new files are, by default, excluded from the feedback request, but you can hover over their entry in the list and click \"+\" to add them. Hover over an excluded file and click on the trashcan to permanently exclude it from all future feedback requests. Permanently excluding files creates a .codestreamignore file in the repository. If you think your teammates will also want to exclude these files (e.g., a package-lock.json or other system-generated file), you can commit and push the file so that they can make use of it as well. The changes represented across the selected files are broken out into four different categories, allowing you to select exactly what you would like to include in the feedback request. This includes changes that haven't been pushed, or even committed! Saved Changes Staged Changes Local Commits Pushed Commits Note that commits are listed in descending order across the Local Commits and Pushed Commits sections, and unchecking the box for a commit will automatically uncheck the boxes for all preceding commits. In other words, the commits included in the feedback request must be consecutive. Only your commits are checked by default, but you can include any of them in your review. (Tip: Make sure the email address in your git configuration matches your CodeStream email address. Or set up a blame map to map your git email address to you CodeStream email address.) Lastly, you can optionally share the feedback request out to either Slack or Microsoft Teams. When you submit your feedback request, teammates will be notified via the activity feed, with anyone assigned as a reviewer being @mentioned so that they’ll also receive an email notification. Providing feedback The best part of CodeStream's feedback requests is that having your teammates look over your code doesn't put any extra burden on them. No need for them to set aside their own work to switch branches or pull changes, and no need to for them to leave their IDE. As long as they have the appropriate repo, they can simply open the feedback request and start reviewing the changes. Click on any file in the Changed Files section to review the changes. You’ll be presented with a diff in your editor, and you can step through the changes in the file using your IDE's native navigation or the up/down arrows in the Changed Files section. Note that for JetBrains IDEs, CodeStream doesn't currently support the \"Unified viewer\" for diffs. Just the \"Side-by-side viewer\". Typically, the diff will represent the changes in the branch associated with the feedback request (i.e., usually a feature/topic branch) against the base branch, at the point at which the feature branch was created. Note that with CodeStream diffs this may not always be the case since the developer may not have included all of their changes in the feedback request. As a result, the version of the files that the changes are being diff’ed against may, in fact, also include changes that aren’t in the base branch. This is important in order to provide continuity. Comments & Change Requests If you have a general comment about the changes, just add a reply to the feedback request's thread. But if you want to comment on the actual changes, just select some code from the right side of the diff and then click on the comment button that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ c, or ctrl+/ c on a Mac) after selecting some code. Since you have the full file context, you aren’t limited to commenting on just the lines of code that changed. For example, you might notice another part of the file that needs work as well, or that you simply want to reference. Whether it’s a general comment or a comment on code, you can mark it a “change request” to let the developer know that it’s required before you’ll approve the changes. While you are providing feedback, you can even comment on files that are not part of the changeset, and they will get added as a reply to the review. This is helpful to be able to point your teammate to another location in the codebase that might be an example of a better way to do something. All of the change requests associated with the the feedback request are summarized in a section at the top, in addition to being part of the discussion thread. This is where they will get marked complete when the work is done. Look for the green and red buttons at the top to either approve the changes or request that additional changes be made. Note that if there are any open change requests, the approve button will be replaced by a blue button that indicates the number. You can still approve the changes but we wanted to make sure you were aware of the outstanding work. When there are multiple reviewers, and approval is required from each, CodeStream makes it very clear when there are still outstanding approvals. The blue button at the top-right indicates how many approvals are outstanding, and the green “thumbs up” on the headshots of reviewers indicates those that have already approved. Adding more code changes A typical workflow involves the reviewer leaving some comments or suggesting some changes, and then the developer responding to that feedback with more changes to the code. To continue the process, click the blue Amend button to add your changes. As when you originally submitted the feedback request, you can choose from your saved and stages changes, and your local and pushed commits. Any open change requests are listed as well so that you can mark off any that are addressed by the update. When the reviewer goes back into the feedback request, by default they’ll be looking at the complete changeset (i.e., changes across all updates) as they go through the diffs for each file. They can, however, elect to view the diffs specific to any individual update. This process can continue across as many updates as needed to get to the ultimate approval of the changes. And once the feedback request has been approved, you can create a pull request, right from CodeStream, to get your code merged. Note that the feedback request may not be amended or reopened once a pull request has been created.",

There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

      "body": "CodeStream is a developer collaboration platform that makes it incredibly easy for development teams, especially remote teams, to discuss and review code in a more natural and contextual way. CodeStream not only makes discussions easier, by allowing them to happen in your IDE, in context, but also preserves the institutional knowledge that is currently being lost in Slack channels and emails. Discuss code just like commenting on a Google Doc Simply select a block of code and type your question or comment. Teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, and you can optionally share the discussion on Slack or Microsoft Teams so teammates can participate from their chat clients as well. Get feedback on work-in-progress with pre-PR code review CodeStream's lightweight feedback requests let you have someone look over your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest. CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that hasn’t even been committed?

      "body": "CodeStream's Feedback Requests are powerful enough to use for traditional end-of-cycle code reviews, but at the same time they're so easy and flexible that you can use them throughout the development process to get quick feedback on your work in progress. Even if you haven't committed your changes! Traditional code review happens at the end of the development cycle, when you’re looking to get the changes merged. Not only are end-of-cycle code reviews much more burdensome on your teammates, but you run the risk of identifying issues so late in the game that you end up having to decide between blowing up your schedule or taking on technical debt. Whether you’re at the very beginning of a project, with just some stubbed out functions, are mid-way through a work in progress, or are ready for a final review of a finished project, CodeStream allows you to get feedback at any point during the development cycle. CodeStream handles the complexity of sharing your current status, including pushed commits, local commits, and staged and saved changes. Teammates can provide feedback right from their IDE, with no need to switch applications, and no need to switch branches or pull changes. By the time you get to that formal code review/pull request at the end of the development cycle, it’s far less painful and more of a formality because issues have been raised, discussed and resolved all along the way. Requesting feedback Request feedback at any time, regardless of the current state of your work, by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Feedback Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ r, or ctrl+/ r on a Mac). With a single click you can name the feedback request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. CodeStream assumes that you are requesting feedback on changes in the repo/branch of the file currently selected in your editor. If you have multiple repositories open in your IDE, you can change this via the repo dropdown at the very top of the form. Depending on your organization's settings, CodeStream may suggest some reviewers. Based on the commit history of the code being changed, the suggestions may even include someone that isn't yet on your CodeStream team (in which case they'd be notified via email). Hover over a reviewer’s name to see more details or to remove them. If multiple reviewers are assigned you may also have the option to determine whether any of them can approve the review, or if each one has to approve it individually. The Changed Files section lists all of the files that have been added, removed or modified. Click on any file to view a diff if you want to review your changes before submitting the feedback request. If you have a file that’s not suitable for review, such as a checked-in binary file, you can hover over any file and click the \"x\" to exclude that file from the feedback request. That file will be moved to a list below the form. Note that new files are, by default, excluded from the feedback request, but you can hover over their entry in the list and click \"+\" to add them. Hover over an excluded file and click on the trashcan to permanently exclude it from all future feedback requests. Permanently excluding files creates a .codestreamignore file in the repository. If you think your teammates will also want to exclude these files (e.g., a package-lock.json or other system-generated file), you can commit and push the file so that they can make use of it as well. The changes represented across the selected files are broken out into four different categories, allowing you to select exactly what you would like to include in the feedback request. This includes changes that haven't been pushed, or even committed! Saved Changes Staged Changes Local Commits Pushed Commits Note that commits are listed in descending order across the Local Commits and Pushed Commits sections, and unchecking the box for a commit will automatically uncheck the boxes for all preceding commits. In other words, the commits included in the feedback request must be consecutive. Only your commits are checked by default, but you can include any of them in your review. (Tip: Make sure the email address in your git configuration matches your CodeStream email address. Or set up a blame map to map your git email address to you CodeStream email address.) Lastly, you can optionally share the feedback request out to either Slack or Microsoft Teams. When you submit your feedback request, teammates will be notified via the activity feed, with anyone assigned as a reviewer being @mentioned so that they’ll also receive an email notification. Providing feedback The best part of CodeStream's feedback requests is that having your teammates look over your code doesn't put any extra burden on them. No need for them to set aside their own work to switch branches or pull changes, and no need to for them to leave their IDE. As long as they have the appropriate repo, they can simply open the feedback request and start reviewing the changes. Click on any file in the Changed Files section to review the changes. You’ll be presented with a diff in your editor, and you can step through the changes in the file using your IDE's native navigation or the up/down arrows in the Changed Files section. Note that for JetBrains IDEs, CodeStream doesn't currently support the \"Unified viewer\" for diffs. Just the \"Side-by-side viewer\". Typically, the diff will represent the changes in the branch associated with the feedback request (i.e., usually a feature/topic branch) against the base branch, at the point at which the feature branch was created. Note that with CodeStream diffs this may not always be the case since the developer may not have included all of their changes in the feedback request. As a result, the version of the files that the changes are being diff’ed against may, in fact, also include changes that aren’t in the base branch. This is important in order to provide continuity. Comments & Change Requests If you have a general comment about the changes, just add a reply to the feedback request's thread. But if you want to comment on the actual changes, just select some code from the right side of the diff and then click on the comment button that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ c, or ctrl+/ c on a Mac) after selecting some code. Since you have the full file context, you aren’t limited to commenting on just the lines of code that changed. For example, you might notice another part of the file that needs work as well, or that you simply want to reference. Whether it’s a general comment or a comment on code, you can mark it a “change request” to let the developer know that it’s required before you’ll approve the changes. While you are providing feedback, you can even comment on files that are not part of the changeset, and they will get added as a reply to the review. This is helpful to be able to point your teammate to another location in the codebase that might be an example of a better way to do something. All of the change requests associated with the the feedback request are summarized in a section at the top, in addition to being part of the discussion thread. This is where they will get marked complete when the work is done. Look for the green and red buttons at the top to either approve the changes or request that additional changes be made. Note that if there are any open change requests, the approve button will be replaced by a blue button that indicates the number. You can still approve the changes but we wanted to make sure you were aware of the outstanding work. When there are multiple reviewers, and approval is required from each, CodeStream makes it very clear when there are still outstanding approvals. The blue button at the top-right indicates how many approvals are outstanding, and the green “thumbs up” on the headshots of reviewers indicates those that have already approved. Adding more code changes A typical workflow involves the reviewer leaving some comments or suggesting some changes, and then the developer responding to that feedback with more changes to the code. To continue the process, click the blue Amend button to add your changes. As when you originally submitted the feedback request, you can choose from your saved and stages changes, and your local and pushed commits. Any open change requests are listed as well so that you can mark off any that are addressed by the update. When the reviewer goes back into the feedback request, by default they’ll be looking at the complete changeset (i.e., changes across all updates) as they go through the diffs for each file. They can, however, elect to view the diffs specific to any individual update. This process can continue across as many updates as needed to get to the ultimate approval of the changes. And once the feedback request has been approved, you can create a pull request, right from CodeStream, to get your code merged. Note that the feedback request may not be amended or reopened once a pull request has been created.",

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

      "body": "CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents. Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can to jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can use all of CodeStream's collaboration tools to discuss the code, request feedback, and submit a pull request to resolve the issue and push up the fix to your repository. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Give us your repository's URL Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you can connect those things with your repository. In order to link your data in New Relic to your code, we need to know the URL for your repository. For example, the URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. You can use any one of these methods to set up your repository: Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. For APM, mobile, browser, and Lambda monitoring, find the Connect repository button on the right-hand side. To connect your repository, click Connnect repository, then find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup. Dynamic logging with Go and Pixie New Relic account New Relic user API key CodeStream and New Relic connection A Kubernetes cluster monitored by Pixie An application written in Go You can use CodeStream to enable dynamic logging for your Pixie-monitored Go applications. For relevant projects, you can use CodeStream to dynamically log your Go method names in your IDE.",

Connecting to Microsoft Teams Click here to install the CodeStream app or go to \"Apps\" in your Teams sidebar and search for CodeStream. Once installed you should see the following popup for the CodeStream app, click on the Add button. Note, do not expand it and select the options to add to team or chat. Simply click Add. This will take you to your private chat with the CodeStream bot, and you’ll see the CodeStream logo appear in the Teams sidebar. Type signin in this chat and submit. A post from the bot will appear in the stream, along with a “Sign in” button. Click the button and you’ll be taken to the web and prompted to sign into CodeStream. After signing in you’ll be provided with a token that you’ll need to copy and paste into your chat with the CodeStream bot back in MS Teams. Paste the token into the chat and submit. Go to a channel in which you’d like to share, type @, and then select Get bots from the popup. Select the CodeStream bot from the list (and search for it if you need to), and then click \"Add\".

You’ll be first taken through a CodeStream web page where you’ll specify which IDE to open, and CodeStream will remember this selection for the next time you view a discussion from the same repository. You’ll then be taken to the appropriate source file in your IDE, scrolled to the relevant block of code, with the discussion displayed in the CodeStream pane. If you don’t happen to have the given repository open in your IDE, CodeStream will automatically open the source file for you (assuming you’ve opened that repository previously, with CodeStream installed, so that we know where to find it).

You can sign up by either creating a set of CodeStream credentials (such as, email address and password), or you can sign up using GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket (cloud versions only). Signing up via your code host saves you from having to connect later, but if the email address you're using there isn't your work email you should create CodeStream credentials instead. If you sign up via CodeStream, your next step will be to confirm your email address by entering a code sent to you via email. Note that you can paste the code into any of the boxes rather than typing each number individually. CodeStream organizations [$organizations] An “organization” on CodeStream is where you and your teammates will discuss code. Similar to a Slack workspace, all of the developers in your company should be in the same CodeStream organization. This is true even for very large organizations as CodeStream's activity feed keeps things relevant for each member by showing just activity related to the code you have open in your IDE. The discussions about code build up a knowledge base that is a company-wide resource, so the only reason to have multiple organizations on CodeStream is if you truly need separation. For example, you might have an organization for your day job and another for an open-source project you work on. Or maybe you're a consultant that is a member of different CodeStream organizations for each of your clients. Create or join an organization If you were invited to join an organization on CodeStream, all you need to do is sign up using the same email address the invitation was sent to. You'll automatically be added to that organization. If you're the first person from your company to sign up for CodeStream you can go ahead and create a new organization. Otherwise, there may be existing CodeStream organizations available for you to join based on your email domain. If you think your company is already on CodeStream, but don't see an organization to join, make sure that you've signed up with your work email address. Click the link to change your email address if necessary. If you decide to create an organization you'll be asked to give it a name, and if you signed up with your work email address, you'll also be able to indicate that anyone else on that email domain can join the organization.

      "body": "For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow right in your IDE. There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

Select \"Blame Map\" to define code ownership with your organization. By default, when you comment on code, CodeStream mentions (or offers to email) the author(s) of the code you are commenting on. But if that person has left the company it might not be the right thing to do. Note that non-admins are able to set up blame maps for themselves to handle situations where the email address they use to commit code is different than the one they used to sign up for CodeStream. Organization Settings If you are an organization admin, look for the Organization Admin menu under the headshot menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Onboarding Settings Domain-based joining allows anyone with email addresses on the specified domains to join your CodeStream organization without being first invited. Not only does this make it very easy to get your teammates on board, but it ensures that they'll be part of your organization (as opposed to accidentally creating their own). Feedback Request Assignment & Approval Admins can control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for the organization. By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the organization. Any reviewer can approve - Any one can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers are assigned. All reviewers must approve individually - Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved. You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. Round-robin will cycle through all developers in the organization. Random will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The Authorship options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch.

Create an account If you already have the CodeStream extension installed in your IDE, you can start the signup process from the CodeStream pane. You can sign up by either creating a set of CodeStream credentials (such as, email address and password), or you can sign up using GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket (cloud versions only). Signing up via your code host saves you from having to connect later, but if the email address you're using there isn't your work email you should create CodeStream credentials instead. If you sign up via CodeStream, your next step will be to confirm your email address by entering a code sent to you via email. Note that you can paste the code into any of the boxes rather than typing each number individually. CodeStream organizations [$organizations] An “organization” on CodeStream is where you and your teammates will discuss code. Similar to a Slack workspace, all of the developers in your company should be in the same CodeStream organization. This is true even for very large organizations as CodeStream's activity feed keeps things relevant for each member by showing just activity related to the code you have open in your IDE. The discussions about code build up a knowledge base that is a company-wide resource, so the only reason to have multiple organizations on CodeStream is if you truly need separation. For example, you might have an organization for your day job and another for an open-source project you work on. Or maybe you're a consultant that is a member of different CodeStream organizations for each of your clients. Create or join an organization If you were invited to join an organization on CodeStream, all you need to do is sign up using the same email address the invitation was sent to. You'll automatically be added to that organization. If you're the first person from your company to sign up for CodeStream you can go ahead and create a new organization. Otherwise, there may be existing CodeStream organizations available for you to join based on your email domain. If you think your company is already on CodeStream, but don't see an organization to join, make sure that you've signed up with your work email address. Click the link to change your email address if necessary. If you decide to create an organization you'll be asked to give it a name, and if you signed up with your work email address, you'll also be able to indicate that anyone else on that email domain can join the organization. Invite your team Collaboration is a team sport so invite your teammates to join you on CodeStream! CodeStream will offer up some suggestions based on the commit history of the repositories you have open in your IDE. Now you're ready to start using CodeStream.",

      "body": "For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow right in your IDE. There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

      "body": "CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents. Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can to jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can use all of CodeStream's collaboration tools to discuss the code, request feedback, and submit a pull request to resolve the issue and push up the fix to your repository. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Give us your repository's URL Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you can connect those things with your repository. In order to link your data in New Relic to your code, we need to know the URL for your repository. For example, the URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. You can use any one of these methods to set up your repository: Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. For APM, mobile, browser, and Lambda monitoring, find the Connect repository button on the right-hand side. To connect your repository, click Connnect repository, then find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup. Dynamic logging with Go and Pixie New Relic account New Relic user API key CodeStream and New Relic connection A Kubernetes cluster monitored by Pixie An application written in Go You can use CodeStream to enable dynamic logging for your Pixie-monitored Go applications. For relevant projects, you can use CodeStream to dynamically log your Go method names in your IDE.",

      "body": "For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow right in your IDE. There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring for Android monitors your mobile app, giving you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for Android apps written using Java or Kotlin. Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes.

Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can to jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can use all of CodeStream's collaboration tools to discuss the code, request feedback, and submit a pull request to resolve the issue and push up the fix to your repository. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Give us your repository's URL Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you can connect those things with your repository. In order to link your data in New Relic to your code, we need to know the URL for your repository. For example, the URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. You can use any one of these methods to set up your repository: Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. For APM, mobile, browser, and Lambda monitoring, find the Connect repository button on the right-hand side. To connect your repository, click Connnect repository, then find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring for Android monitors your mobile app, giving you a comprehensive view of your app's performance. It works for Android apps written using Java or Kotlin. Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

Create an account If you already have the CodeStream extension installed in your IDE, you can start the signup process from the CodeStream pane. You can sign up by either creating a set of CodeStream credentials (such as, email address and password), or you can sign up using GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket (cloud versions only). Signing up via your code host saves you from having to connect later, but if the email address you're using there isn't your work email you should create CodeStream credentials instead. If you sign up via CodeStream, your next step will be to confirm your email address by entering a code sent to you via email. Note that you can paste the code into any of the boxes rather than typing each number individually. CodeStream organizations [$organizations] An “organization” on CodeStream is where you and your teammates will discuss code. Similar to a Slack workspace, all of the developers in your company should be in the same CodeStream organization. This is true even for very large organizations as CodeStream's activity feed keeps things relevant for each member by showing just activity related to the code you have open in your IDE. The discussions about code build up a knowledge base that is a company-wide resource, so the only reason to have multiple organizations on CodeStream is if you truly need separation. For example, you might have an organization for your day job and another for an open-source project you work on. Or maybe you're a consultant that is a member of different CodeStream organizations for each of your clients. Create or join an organization If you were invited to join an organization on CodeStream, all you need to do is sign up using the same email address the invitation was sent to. You'll automatically be added to that organization. If you're the first person from your company to sign up for CodeStream you can go ahead and create a new organization. Otherwise, there may be existing CodeStream organizations available for you to join based on your email domain. If you think your company is already on CodeStream, but don't see an organization to join, make sure that you've signed up with your work email address. Click the link to change your email address if necessary. If you decide to create an organization you'll be asked to give it a name, and if you signed up with your work email address, you'll also be able to indicate that anyone else on that email domain can join the organization. Invite your team Collaboration is a team sport so invite your teammates to join you on CodeStream! CodeStream will offer up some suggestions based on the commit history of the repositories you have open in your IDE. Now you're ready to start using CodeStream.",

Learn more about how to use CodeStream. 2. Connect your tools Create and review pull requests on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. Create issues on Jira, Trello, and other issue trackers. Share code discussions on Slack or Microsoft Teams. CodeStream brings the tools you use every day together in your IDE. Click on your headshot at the top of the CodeStream pane and go to the Integrations page to get all of your tools connected. 3. Discuss any block of code, at any time Whether you're trying to understand someone else's code or getting help with some code you just wrote, just select the code and ask your question. Learn more about discussing code. 4. Get feedback on your work in progress Select \"Request Feedback\" from the \"+\" menu at any time in the development cycle, whether it’s a quick look over some work in progress (even uncommitted code!) or a formal review of a completed effort. Teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with no need to switch branches or set aside their own work. Learn more about feedback requests. 5. Create or review a pull request Look for the Pull Requests section of the CodeStream sidebar to review an open pull request. Just click on a pull request (or load one from URL) to get a complete GitHub experience right in your IDE!

Select \"Blame Map\" to define code ownership with your organization. By default, when you comment on code, CodeStream mentions (or offers to email) the author(s) of the code you are commenting on. But if that person has left the company it might not be the right thing to do. Note that non-admins are able to set up blame maps for themselves to handle situations where the email address they use to commit code is different than the one they used to sign up for CodeStream. Organization Settings If you are an organization admin, look for the Organization Admin menu under the headshot menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Onboarding Settings Domain-based joining allows anyone with email addresses on the specified domains to join your CodeStream organization without being first invited. Not only does this make it very easy to get your teammates on board, but it ensures that they'll be part of your organization (as opposed to accidentally creating their own). Feedback Request Assignment & Approval Admins can control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for the organization. By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the organization. Any reviewer can approve - Any one can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers are assigned. All reviewers must approve individually - Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved. You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. Round-robin will cycle through all developers in the organization. Random will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The Authorship options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch.

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

      "body": "The activity feed is the definitive place to find out about new comments, issues and feedback requests posted by your teammates, or new replies to existing discussions. When you’re not on the activity feed, you can always tell whether or not there’s anything new by looking for a badge on the Activity Feed icon. A blue badge with a white dot means that there are new discussions or replies, and a blue badge with a number inside means that there are new discussions or replies where you’ve been mentioned (with the number indicating the number of mentions). Note that CodeStream’s entry in your IDE’s status bar also let’s you know when there are new messages in the feed. A dot to the right of your username means there are new messages, and a number means there are new mentions. A filter at the top of the activity feed allows you to determine what you'll see in the feed. Activity from everyone in my organization - This option allows you to see all activity from your organization, and should only be used in very small organizations. Activity associated with code open in my IDE (default) - You'll only see discussions related to code in the repositories you have open in your IDE, although you'll always see posts where you're @mentioned even if it's associated with code from other repositories. Activity associated with code in selected folder - This option is geared towards those of you working with monorepos. You'll only see discussions related to code in the selected folder, although you'll always see posts where you're @mentioned even if it's associated with code from other folders. As you might expect, new stuff gets added to the top of the feed, even if it’s a new reply to a very old discussion. CodeStream makes it even easier to identify what’s new by adding a blue border on the left side. For example, here’s a new comment at the top of the feed. And here is a new reply to a comment. The fact that only the replies have the blue border means that you’ve previously seen the comment itself. Also note the “See 1 earlier reply”. That means that there's an earlier reply that you’ve already seen. Only new, unread replies are displayed in the main activity feed view, but you can click on that link to see the full discussion thread and add a new reply of your own. The activity feed goes all the way back to the beginning of time for your team, but if you’re looking for specific older codemarks you might be better off going to Filter & Search.",

By default, you are set to automatically follow any comment, issue or feedback request that you created, where you’ve been mentioned (either in the original post or in a subsequent reply), or to which you’ve replied. You can always elect to follow/unfollow any individual comment, issue or feedback request via its ellipses menu. Email notifications are sent immediately.

Be sure that when you reply you are doing so from the same email address to which the notification was sent (i.e., your email address on CodeStream). Also note that you can unfollow a codemark or code review by clicking the link at the bottom of the email. If you’re using CodeStream in VS Code or a JetBrains IDE you’ll also receive desktop notifications in the IDE for comment, issue or feedback request that you follow. Clicking on the Open button will open the discussion so that you can participate. Other Notifications CodeStream also offers the following notifications that can be turned on and off via the checkboxes at the bottom of the page. Notify me about outstanding feedback requests - You'll get an email reminder about open feedback requests assigned to you that you haven't responded to in the last 24 hours. Notify me about new unreviewed commits from teammates when I pull - Any time you pull, if there are new commits from a teammate on the current branch you'll get a toast notification. Click the \"Review\" button to start reviewing your teammate's changes and provide feedback. Send me weekly emails summarizing my activity - Sent every Monday with information about you and your organization's activity for the previous week. If you've connected to GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to leverage CodeStream's pull request integration you'll also be notified when a pull request is assigned to you or you are added as a reviewer.

      "body": "For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow right in your IDE. There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

      "body": "For most development teams, the final step in the development process is a pull request. Even if your team has decided to use CodeStream's feedback requests as a replacement for, and not just a precursor to, your end-of-cycle PR-based code reviews, CodeStream allows you to keep all of that workflow right in your IDE. There are three elements of CodeStream's pull-request integration, and the following table outlines which code-hosting services are supported for each. Feature Supported Services Create a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server Create a pull request across forks GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Review and edit a pull request GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed Display pull request comments as code annotations GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Creating a pull request Open a pull request at any time by clicking on the \"+\" button at the top of the CodeStream pane, or the \"+\" button in the header of the Pull Requests section. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (ctlr+shift+/ p, or ctrl+/ p on a Mac... and you can use m if you're a GitLab user). CodeStream even provides you with different options (tree view, list view, diff hunks) for reviewing your changes before opening the pull request. With a single click you can name the pull request based on the last commit message, the branch name, or, if you started work by selecting a ticket, the ticket title. If you have a ticket selected, you can also explicitly tie the ticket to the pull request, and CodeStream will include a link to the ticket in the pull request's description. Before submitting the pull request you can even review your changes by clicking on any of the files listed below the form. To create a pull request across forks, click on the \"compare across forks\" link at the top of the page and the form will update to allow you to select both the base and head repositories. You can also create a pull request from within a CodeStream feedback request. Once the feedback request has been approved, you’ll see an option to open a pull request at the top. Before you can create a pull request you’ll need to make sure that any changes included in the feedback request have been committed and pushed. Also, if the feature branch you’re working on doesn’t have a remote tracking branch you’ll be given the option to set that as part of creating the pull request. When you create a pull request from a feedback request, CodeStream connect's the dots between the two by adding a link to the pull request to the feedback request. And by adding a link to the feedback request, along with information about who did the review and when, in the description of the pull request. Reviewing a pull request The ability to review pull requests is currently not available for Bitbucket. Regardless of where the pull request was created, you can edit, review, and even merge it, right from CodeStream. We've essentially brought GitHub and GitLab right into your IDE, so there's zero learning curve. If you know how to work with pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, you'll know how to do it in CodeStream as well. Edit a GitHub pull request's details, such as reviewers, assignees and labels. For a GitLab merge request, you can use edit mode (via the dropdown at the top of the page) or use the sidebar. By default, you can only add a single reviewer and a single assignee to a GitLab merge request. If your organization supports multiple reviewers and assignees, click the gear menu in the heading of the Merge Requests section of the CodeStream pane to enable this. Review the conversation and add comments, with the ability to @mention your collaborators. View the changes, add comments, and submit a review. Of course, we did improve upon the GitHub/GitLab experience in a couple of important ways. On GitHub and GitLab you can only view the changes as a series of \"diff hunks\". CodeStream provides that view as well, but if you'd prefer to see the changes in the context of the full file, and not just the lines that changed, you can use either List View or Tree View. Just select the code you want to comment on, and then click on the Comment button (or select Comment from the context menu). When commenting you can either add a single comment, or start a review. Another difference is that CodeStream allows you to comment on lines of code that haven't changed. You can select ANY lines of code in the diff, and not just those that are part of the changeset. Note that these comments are added as a \"single comment\" to the pull request and aren't part of any review you may have in progress. All the power of GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests, and then some, right in your IDE. Leveraging pull request comments Once the pull request has been approved and the code has been merged that's usually the end of life for any comments in that pull request. Although there is often useful information in those comments, that may have long-term value, they are rarely seen again. CodeStream gives those comments a second life by displaying them alongside the blocks of code that they refer to. To have pull request comments displayed as annotions in your codemarks, as well as in the Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane, click on the gear icon in that section and check the box to \"Show comments from pull requests\". When you first check that box, if you haven’t already authenticated with your code-hosting service you’ll be prompted to do so. Comments from merged PRs will appear next to the blocks of code they refer to. Comments from open PRs will also be included if you are on a relevant branch. For example, if the open PR is a request to merge the feature/some-name branch into main, you’ll see comments from that PR if you are checked out to either feature/some-name or main, but not when you’re on any other branch. As the code evolves, the location of each comment is automatically updated so that it remains linked to the block of code it refers to. Note that PR comments for a given file are updated roughly every 30 minutes, so new comments may not appear right away. You can force an update by restarting your IDE.",

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

An existing Jira ticket. A wiki. A thread in your messaging service. Whatever the case may be, just look for the “Copy link” option under the ellipses menu. Whenever someone clicks on the link, after authenticating with CodeStream they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the discussion will automatically be opened. In the case of a comment or issue, the source file will also be opened and scrolled to the corresponding block of code. CodeStream does its best to determine which IDE to open, largley based on the IDE that you last used to access CodeStream. However, you can always return to the web page that was opened and select any IDE. Your selection will be remembered for the next time you attempt to open a discussion associated with the same repository. Note that if you’re using a JetBrains IDE you’ll need to first install the Toolbox App so that CodeStream can deep link into the IDE. Permalinks for Code Blocks Sometimes you don’t necessarily want to comment on a block of code, but instead just want to easily share the code with a teammate. CodeStream's permalinks are \"living\" links that will always point to the code in question, even if it's moved to a different location in the file. Select the code in your editor and then click the button to get a permalink for that code. Decide whether you want the permalink to be public or private, with private permalinks requiring CodeStream authentication before the code can be viewed. Copy your permalink and paste anywhere you'd like to share the block of code. Just like with comments, issues and feedback requests, whenever someone clicks on the permalink they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the source file will be opened and scrolled to the corresponding block of code.",

      "body": "NOTE #1: Recent versions of Jira Server (>=8.14.0) support the use of API Tokens to access the Jira Server REST API. We recommend you use API Tokens if possible to avoid the more complicated setup described here. Check your Jira Server version. NOTE #2: You must be a Jira administrator in order to configure this integration. To determine if you have the proper permissions in order to proceed, look for the Jira Settings menu (cog icon, mostly likely at the top-right next to your headshot) and make sure there's an \"Applications\" option there. If you don't have the Settings menu, or the Applications option, then you won't be able to configure the integration. NOTE #3: This integration requires that your Jira Server instance be at a publicly accessible URL. CodeStream can integrate with Jira Server using Atlassian’s published REST API. To enable CodeStream to integrate with your Jira Server installation, you will need to set up a CodeStream application link. This application link serves as a conduit for users to authenticate against their Jira Server account without ever having to enter their credentials in CodeStream. Jira Server uses the OAuth standard (version 1.0a) for client authorization. For reference, this page from Atlassian describes the process: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/oauth/. However, you do not need to follow the full instructions on that page; the relevant instructions are duplicated and simplified here for clarity. Note that you will need the openssl command-line tool to generate a public/private key pair for use with the application link. Generate a public/private key pair In a terminal, use openssl to generate your public/private key pair, following these steps carefully: Generate a 1024-bit private key: openssl genrsa -out jira_privatekey.pem 1024 Create an X509 certificate: openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -key jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_publickey.cer -days 365 Enter whatever information you see fit to accompany the certificate. Extract the private key (PKCS8 format) to the jira_privatekey.pcks8 file: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in jira_privatekey.pem -out jira_privatekey.pcks8 Extract the public key from the certificate to the jira_publickey.pem file: openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in jira_publickey.cer > jira_publickey.pem Create an application link Follow these steps to create your application link within Jira Server. In Jira, navigate to Jira settings (gear icon in upper-right), select Applications. Type in your Administrator password if needed. Then select Application links under \"Integrations\", in the left sidebar. Where it says Enter the URL of the application you want to link, enter any URL you want, for example, http://example.com/. Then click Create new link. You will likely see a warning starting with: No response was received from the URL you entered. You can ignore the warning; click Continue. Fill out the form as you see here, or as you like. None of the data entered here really matters, except to make sure that Create incoming link is checked. The Application Name can be whatever name works best for you to identify the link. Then click Continue. On the next dialog, enter any unique string you want for the Consumer Key. It does not need to be secure or encoded, just something fairly easy to remember. Make a note of what you enter here; it will be needed when you go to set up the integration with Jira Server from CodeStream. For Consumer Name, you can enter anything meaningful to you, like \"CodeStream app\". The important field to fill out correctly is Public Key; for this you will want to copy the full text of the contents of the jira_publickey.pem file you created in Step #1. Paste this into the Public Key field, then click Continue. The application link you created should now show like this: Set up the integration in CodeStream Now you are ready to set up the integration from CodeStream to Jira Server for your team, using the application link you just created. Assuming you have signed up for CodeStream and have the extension open in your IDE: In CodeStream, go to the Integrations panel by clicking the menu next to your username in the top-left. Then click Jira Server under \"Issue Providers\". Since you will not be using API Tokens with your Jira Server integration, you'll need to click at the top where it says \"Click here if you organization uses a version of Jira Server older than...\" to configure Jira Server using the OAuth method described herein. Fill out the form as follows. For Jira Server Base URL, enter the URL used to access your Jira Server installation as known to your internal network, in the form http(s)://host:port. For Consumer Key, use the \"consumer key\" you entered when created the application link, from Step #2, above. Then copy the full contents of the private key, in PCKS8 format, that you created in Step #1 above. The file should be called jira_privatekey.pcks8. Paste those contents into the Private Key field, then click Submit. You'll then be taken to your Jira Server instance, where you'll approve access to your account using the application link. When you are finished, return to your IDE and you should see something similar to this: Now that the integration has been set up for your organization, other users will NOT have to go through the process described above. Other users in your organization will see the integration with your Jira Server (specified by host) alongside other available integrations. Initiating this integration will only require your other users to allow the CodeStream application link to access their account, as you did in the final step.",

An existing Jira ticket. A wiki. A thread in your messaging service. Whatever the case may be, just look for the “Copy link” option under the ellipses menu. Whenever someone clicks on the link, after authenticating with CodeStream they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the discussion will automatically be opened. In the case of a comment or issue, the source file will also be opened and scrolled to the corresponding block of code. CodeStream does its best to determine which IDE to open, largley based on the IDE that you last used to access CodeStream. However, you can always return to the web page that was opened and select any IDE. Your selection will be remembered for the next time you attempt to open a discussion associated with the same repository. Note that if you’re using a JetBrains IDE you’ll need to first install the Toolbox App so that CodeStream can deep link into the IDE. Permalinks for Code Blocks Sometimes you don’t necessarily want to comment on a block of code, but instead just want to easily share the code with a teammate. CodeStream's permalinks are \"living\" links that will always point to the code in question, even if it's moved to a different location in the file. Select the code in your editor and then click the button to get a permalink for that code. Decide whether you want the permalink to be public or private, with private permalinks requiring CodeStream authentication before the code can be viewed. Copy your permalink and paste anywhere you'd like to share the block of code. Just like with comments, issues and feedback requests, whenever someone clicks on the permalink they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the source file will be opened and scrolled to the corresponding block of code.",

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

Connecting to Microsoft Teams Click here to install the CodeStream app or go to \"Apps\" in your Teams sidebar and search for CodeStream. Once installed you should see the following popup for the CodeStream app, click on the Add button. Note, do not expand it and select the options to add to team or chat. Simply click Add. This will take you to your private chat with the CodeStream bot, and you’ll see the CodeStream logo appear in the Teams sidebar. Type signin in this chat and submit. A post from the bot will appear in the stream, along with a “Sign in” button. Click the button and you’ll be taken to the web and prompted to sign into CodeStream. After signing in you’ll be provided with a token that you’ll need to copy and paste into your chat with the CodeStream bot back in MS Teams. Paste the token into the chat and submit. Go to a channel in which you’d like to share, type @, and then select Get bots from the popup. Select the CodeStream bot from the list (and search for it if you need to), and then click \"Add\". Now return to the channel and @mention the CodeStream bot with the connect command. Repeat this in any channel that you'd like to share to. Once you get the following confirmation, you’re ready to share to Teams from CodeStream. When you return to CodeStream you'll now be able to share to the channels that you just connected. Participating from Microsoft Teams When you share to Teams, not only does it notify your teammates about the codemark, but they can use it to jump directly into their IDEs to participate in the conversation on CodeStream. Open in IDE Click “Open in IDE” to view both the code, and the discussion, right inside your IDE. You’ll be first taken through a CodeStream web page where you’ll specify which IDE to open, and CodeStream will remember this selection for the next time you view a discussion from the same repository. You’ll then be taken to the appropriate source file in your IDE, scrolled to the relevant block of code, with the discussion displayed in the CodeStream pane. If you don’t happen to have the given repository open in your IDE, CodeStream will automatically open the source file for you (assuming you’ve opened that repository previously, with CodeStream installed, so that we know where to find it). Note that if you’re using a JetBrains IDE you’ll need to first install the Toolbox App so that CodeStream can deep link into the IDE.

Create an account If you already have the CodeStream extension installed in your IDE, you can start the signup process from the CodeStream pane. You can sign up by either creating a set of CodeStream credentials (such as, email address and password), or you can sign up using GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket (cloud versions only). Signing up via your code host saves you from having to connect later, but if the email address you're using there isn't your work email you should create CodeStream credentials instead. If you sign up via CodeStream, your next step will be to confirm your email address by entering a code sent to you via email. Note that you can paste the code into any of the boxes rather than typing each number individually. CodeStream organizations [$organizations] An “organization” on CodeStream is where you and your teammates will discuss code. Similar to a Slack workspace, all of the developers in your company should be in the same CodeStream organization. This is true even for very large organizations as CodeStream's activity feed keeps things relevant for each member by showing just activity related to the code you have open in your IDE. The discussions about code build up a knowledge base that is a company-wide resource, so the only reason to have multiple organizations on CodeStream is if you truly need separation. For example, you might have an organization for your day job and another for an open-source project you work on. Or maybe you're a consultant that is a member of different CodeStream organizations for each of your clients. Create or join an organization If you were invited to join an organization on CodeStream, all you need to do is sign up using the same email address the invitation was sent to. You'll automatically be added to that organization. If you're the first person from your company to sign up for CodeStream you can go ahead and create a new organization. Otherwise, there may be existing CodeStream organizations available for you to join based on your email domain. If you think your company is already on CodeStream, but don't see an organization to join, make sure that you've signed up with your work email address. Click the link to change your email address if necessary. If you decide to create an organization you'll be asked to give it a name, and if you signed up with your work email address, you'll also be able to indicate that anyone else on that email domain can join the organization.

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature attribute value of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature attribute value of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes.

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Want to know more? Here are a few recommendations for what to do next: Learn about NRDB's data model and flexible schema in our blog post and white paper. Get to know NRQL, our query language, with our Syntax, clauses, and functions page, or read about some of our favorite NRQL capabilities. Read about our query builder, which supports NRQL and PromQL-style queries. Check out UI options for dashboards and charting.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com.

Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months.

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months.

Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities.

You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload.

Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you.

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit. For more on creating queries and alerts for data ingest and billing metrics, see Query billing/usage data. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a chart on the Limits UI page displaying a cardinality violation limit issue. To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page. Troubleshooting system limits To troubleshoot limits when you reach them, click the limit info in the table, and then follow the docs link that's provided. Different limits have different solutions. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Distributed tracing: Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. Timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Distributed tracing: Max spans per minute per account Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M. Distributed tracing: Max spans per trace 50K Distributed tracing: Max attributes per span 200 Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest API limits Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Finding other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph. And for dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing plan, not our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation. For more help For details about the data retention of other products or integrations, see that specific documentation.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page. Troubleshooting system limits To troubleshoot limits when you reach them, click the limit info in the table, and then follow the docs link that's provided. Different limits have different solutions. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Distributed tracing: Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. Timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Distributed tracing: Max spans per minute per account Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M. Distributed tracing: Max spans per trace 50K Distributed tracing: Max attributes per span 200 Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB).

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit. For more on creating queries and alerts for data ingest and billing metrics, see Query billing/usage data. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a chart on the Limits UI page displaying a cardinality violation limit issue. To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page. Troubleshooting system limits To troubleshoot limits when you reach them, click the limit info in the table, and then follow the docs link that's provided. Different limits have different solutions. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Distributed tracing: Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. Timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Distributed tracing: Max spans per minute per account Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M.

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools.

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period.

Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254.

Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "You might find that you ingest data you don't need or want. You can drop some types of data, which enables you: To filter out unimportant low-value data To filter out potentially sensitive data If you choose to drop data, only new data will be affected. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted. Tip If you are sending data to New Relic using Prometheus remote write, you can also drop data by changing the remote_write section of your YAML config file. For more information, see Drop data using Prometheus remote write. Requirements You must have a user role with permissions for dropping data. Currently the following data types can be targeted for data dropping: APM-reported events Browser-reported events Mobile-reported events Synthetics-reported events Custom events (like those generated by the APM agent APIs or the Event API) Log data Trace spans Default infrastructure monitoring events and infrastructure integrations events, with this exception: Downsampled SystemSample, ProcessSample, NetworkSample and StorageSample with time windows longer than 59 minutes can't be dropped. This data doesn't count towards your data ingest. Dimensional metrics, with these caveats: Billing impacts: for New Relic One pricing, dropped data is not billable. For original pricing, dropped data is billable. For metrics generated by the events-to-metrics service: drop rules won't work but these metrics can be stopped or attributes pruned by disabling or re-configuring the events-to-metric rule. Support for additional types are planned for the future. Create drop data rule Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, please review caution information below. To drop data, create a NerdGraph-format drop rule that includes: A NRQL string that specifies what data types to drop An action type specifying how to apply the NRQL string You can form and make the call in the NerdGraph explorer. There are two ways to drop data: Drop entire data types or a data subset (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_DATA action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT * FROM DATA_TYPE_1, DATA_TYPE_2 (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you cannot use anything other than * in the SELECT clause. Drop attributes from data types (with optional filter). This uses the DROP_ATTRIBUTES action type and uses NRQL of the form: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM DATA_TYPE (WHERE OPTIONAL_FILTER) Copy For this type of drop rule, you must pass in a non-empty list of raw attributes names. NRQL restrictions Not all NRQL clauses make sense for generating drop rules. You can provide a WHERE clause to select data with specific attributes. Other features such as TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH, FACET, and other clauses cannot be used. The two action types have these restrictions: DROP_DATA can use only SELECT *. DROP_ATTRIBUTES requires use of SELECT with \"raw\" attributes (attributes with no aggregator function applied). This also means you cannot use SELECT *. Additionally, there are some attributes that are integral to their data type and cannot be dropped (such as timestamp on event data). If you include them, registration will fail. Example drop rules Here are some example drop rules: Drop two event types Let's say you notice you have some event types being sent to New Relic that are not important to you. Also, stopping the source from sending those event types quickly is unrealistic, requiring changes to agents and/or API instrumentation. Using a drop rule is an easier way to accomplish the same goal. Here is an example NerdGraph call that drops two event types: Event1 and Event2. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Event1, Event2\" description: \"Drops all data for Event1 and Event2.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop events meeting certain criteria Let’s say you have a high volume custom event type that arrives from multiple sources. If you don't find all of that data important, you can use a drop rule. Here is an example of a drop rule that filters out events based on specific criteria. mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_DATA nrql: \"SELECT * FROM MyCustomEvent WHERE appName='LoadGeneratingApp' AND environment='development'\" description: \"Drops all data for MyCustomEvent that comes from the LoadGeneratingApp in the dev environment, because there is too much and we don’t look at it.\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Drop sensitive attributes while maintaining the rest of the data Let's say you noticed an event has attributes that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You are working to update your services to stop sending the data, but until then, you need to cease storing further PII in New Relic. Although you could drop all of the data as it comes in the door with a DROP_DATA rule, the rest of the data still provides value. Therefore, you can register a drop rule to remove only the offending PII from your data: mutation { nrqlDropRulesCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rules: [ { action: DROP_ATTRIBUTES nrql: \"SELECT userEmail, userName FROM MyCustomEvent description: \"Removes the user name and email fields from MyCustomEvent\" } ]) { successes { id } failures { submitted { nrql } error { reason description } } } } Copy Verify your drop rule works After you create a drop rule, verify that it is working as expected. The rule should take effect quickly after a successful registration, so try running a TIMESERIES version of the query you registered to see that the data drops off. Drop rule type NRQL DROP_DATA Drop rule NRQL: SELECT * FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(*) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy This should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect any thing else, invert the WHERE clause. DROP_ATTRIBUTES Drop rule NRQL: SELECT dropAttr1, dropAttr2 FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar Copy Validation NRQL: SELECT count(dropAttr1), count(dropAttr2) FROM MyEvent WHERE foo = bar TIMESERIES Copy Both lines should drop to 0. To verify that it did not affect events that contained these attributes and still should, invert the WHERE clause. View rules Here is an example NerdGraph call that returns the drop rules set on an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrqlDropRules { list { rules { id nrql accountId action createdBy createdAt description } error { reason description } } } } } } Copy Delete drop rules Here is an example NerdGraph call deleting two specific drop rules: mutation { nrqlDropRulesDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ruleIds: [\"48\", \"98\"]) { successes { id nrql accountId action description } failures { error { reason description } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy Audit drop rule history To see who created and deleted drop rules, query your account audit logs. The list endpoint also includes the user ID of the person who created the rule. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic does not review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Rules you create, including all information in those rules, can be viewed and edited by any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions. Only new data will be dropped. Existing data cannot be edited or deleted.

      "body": "Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it? Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else? More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in New Relic One provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. With browser monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. But browser monitoring in New Relic goes far beyond the initial page load to measure full page life cycle data. For example, our browser UI shows you: Actual performance data, such as by page view popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) scores Perceived performance data that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display JavaScript error analytics, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself Session performance with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle AJAX requests indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage Hash-based route changes in apps with single-page application (SPA) architectures These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack. Examine user perceptions Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some user-centric performance metrics happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the browser monitoring agent. The PageViewTiming event provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include: First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint First input delay First interaction This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints. Improve interactive app performance Our single-page app (SPA) monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use our browser agent and SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Correlate front-end and back-end problems With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as metrics, events, logs, and traces. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example: Type of data Comments Locations or domains Limit browser monitoring to focus on specific geographical locations or specific types of end-user activity. You can also monitor or block specific domains. Trends in interactions Use our comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and trends appearing in Synthetic monitors. Distributed tracing Isolate latency from the web browser through back-end services with distributed tracing. The UI helps you see the connection across across a full transaction, from browser activity, to time spent in network, to back-end activity. Browser types Explore your end users' experience with your app segmented by any types of browsers they use, including: Top browsers by throughput Average page load time by platform type (mobile, desktop, and other) Selected browser type by version (for example, Chrome 31, 32, 33, etc.) This helps you quickly determine whether problems with page load timing may be related to a specific browser type or platform, or whether the problem is more widespread. Get started with browser monitoring Follow these basic steps, and you'll quickly be up and running in New Relic with browser monitoring! Review the compatibility details and basic requirements for browser monitoring. Install the browser agent. Go to [one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Browser applications. Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. View summary data from your Browser summary page, then drill down into page load timing details and other UI data. Configure your alerts for key performance data, or use our Applied Intelligence solutions to reduce alert noise, correlate incidents, and automatically detect anomalies.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Install the Android agent Before you install the Android agent, make sure your app follows the compatibility requirements. As part of the installation process, mobile monitoring automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app that you monitor. Follow the Android installation and configuration procedures for your environment as applicable. If you have problems with your Android installation, or if you do not see data in the mobile monitoring UI for your Android app, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Extend your instrumentation After you install the agent, extend the agent's instrumentation by using the mobile monitoring UI and following up on information in New Relic Insights. To access: In mobile monitoring: In NRQL and dashboards: Custom data Create and record custom events, interaction traces, and attributes to add details to your existing data and traces. Then, view the custom events that you created in NRQL or dashboards. Network requests Enable the MobileRequest event feature so you can perform a full network analysis. To further investigate network request error rates and response times, query MobileRequest and MobileRequestError events. Crash analysis Review detailed information using groups and filters to analyze trends that lead to crashes. To view more information about crashes, create NRQL queries to review Insights charts related to crash data. Android SDK API Use the Android SDK API for mobile monitoring to instrument parts of your code that are not instrumented by default. Then, view those custom events and attributes in New Relic Insights. Handled exceptions Report exceptions so you can identify factors creating a poor mobile app experience. To further improve performance, review MobileHandledException event records in New Relic Insights. Breadcrumbs Boost the level of detail in crash event trails by adding breadcrumbs. Then, query MobileBreadcrumbs events to see all breadcrumbs or just breadcrumbs related to crashes. See your errors in CodeStream You can also see your Android application's directly in your IDE using CodeStream and errors inbox. To do this, install CodeStream, connect CodeStream and New Relic and create Git tags that match your appVersion.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations.",

The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError Our NrIntegrationError event is used to capture issues related to: Exceeding of our data ingest limits Exceeding of our query limits Malformed data Configuration issues You can run NRQL queries to analyze NrIntegrationError error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur. NrIntegrationError events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the newRelicFeature attribute. Values include: Metrics indicates an issue with Metric API ingest. Event API indicates an issue with Event API ingest. Logs indicates an issue with logs ingest. Distributed Tracing indicates an issue with distributed tracing (Span) data. For attribute definitions, see the data dictionary. Query and alert You can query NrIntegrationError events using NRQL, and set up NRQL alert conditions to get notified when issues happen. Here are some examples of queries: Query of Event API issues Here's a simple query of NrIntegrationError. This one shows Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Query of Metric API issues Here's a simple query of issues with the Metric API: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Limit-related queries See Data limits. Query of distributed tracing issues Here's a simple query of issues with distributed tracing data: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Query of issues over time Here's a query showing a count of NrIntegrationError events over time: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. If you want to examine the structure of this event and see what attributes are attached, you can use a keyset() query, like this: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT keyset() Copy Tutorials and examples Here are links to docs that go into more detail about how to use NrIntegrationError.

      "body": "To view changes made in your New Relic account, you can query NrAuditEvent events. Available events and attributes The NrAuditEvent is created to record configuration changes made in our products. The data gathered for this event includes the type of account change, actor (user or API key) that made the change, a human-readable description of the action taken, and a timestamp for the change. To see all the attributes attached to this event, see NrAuditEvent. Example queries These examples show some of the ways you can run NRQL queries of the NrAuditEvent event. General account changes What changes have been made to the New Relic account? To view all changes to your New Relic account for a specific time frame, run this basic NRQL query: SELECT * from NrAuditEvent SINCE 1 day ago Copy What type of account change was made the most? To query what type of change to the account users was made the most frequently during a specific time frame, include the actionIdentifier attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) AS Actions FROM NrAuditEvent FACET actionIdentifier SINCE 1 week ago Copy What trends appear in account changes? When you include TIMESERIES in a NRQL query, the results are shown as a line graph. For example: SELECT count(*) from NrAuditEvent TIMESERIES facet actionIdentifier since 1 week ago Copy What user management changes have been done? Note that your users' user model will impact these queries. If your users are on our original user model, you can only query per account. If your users are on the New Relic One user model, you should query the top-level account in your New Relic organization. To see all the changes made to users, you could use: SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' SINCE this month Copy If you wanted to narrow that down to see changes to user type (full user vs basic user), you could use: SELECT * FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'user' AND actionIdentifier IN ('user.self_upgrade', 'user.change_type') SINCE this month Copy Synthetics: What changes have been made to a monitor? To query Synthetics monitor updates during a specific time frame, include the actionIdentifier attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' FACET actionIdentifier, description, actorEmail SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy For more information about this Synthetics feature, see Synthetics audit log. Workloads: What changes were made to any workload configuration? To query what configuration changes were made to any workload, use the query below. The targetId attribute contains the GUID of the workload that was modified, which you can use for searches. Since changes on workloads are often automated, you might want to include the actorType attribute to know if the change was done directly by a user through the UI or through the API. SELECT timestamp, actorEmail, actorType, description, targetId FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE targetType = 'workload' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT MAX Copy Changes made by specific users What account changes have been made by any user? To see detailed information about any user who made changes to the account during a specific time frame, include actorType = 'user' in the query. For example: SELECT actionIdentifier, description, actorEmail, actorId, targetType, targetId FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actorType = 'user' SINCE 1 week ago Copy What account changes have been made by a specific user? To query account activities made by a specific person during the selected time frame, you must know their actorId. For example: SELECT actionIdentifier FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actorId = 829034 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Who made the most changes to the account? To identify who (actorType) has made the most changes to the account, include the actorEmail attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) as Users FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actorType = 'user' FACET actorEmail SINCE 1 week ago Copy Synthetics: What monitors were created by a specific user? To query Synthetics monitor updates made by a specific user, include the actionIdentifier and actorEmail attribute in your query. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' FACET actorEmail, actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy Changes made using the API What account changes have been made using an API key? To see detailed information about changes to the account that were made using an API key during a specific time frame, include actorType = 'api_key' in the query.

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds.

      "body": "One type of New Relic data is metric timeslice data. There are several ways to query metric timeslice data: You can query APM metric timeslice data via NRQL (and therefore via our NerdGraph API). You can query any metric timeslice data via the REST API This doc explains how to do this with the REST API. Note that the API is not intended for bulk data extraction of minute-by-minute data points. Time based data All time values returned by the REST API and the API Explorer are UTC (Universal Time Coordinated). Be sure to adjust the time values for data collection as necessary. Time range considerations Important The minimum time range for data requests is one minute (60 seconds). Requests for anything less will result in a 422 status code and no data will be returned. New Relic only collects data at one minute intervals. The API uses the same mechanism for requesting data as the UI: it depends on the time range for the data you request. The objective is to optimize the number of data points returned and provide an easily digestible graph and report. For example: If you request data from a time range of three hours or less, the API returns the one-minute data values originally collected. If you increase the time range to greater than three hours, the data values returned will be an average for two minutes. If you increase the time range to over six hours, the data values returned will be an average for five minutes, and so on. Tip If the initial time for a requested time range is older than eight days, ten evenly spaced data points will be returned for any time range less than four days in length. Here is a summary of the metric value retrieval for the time ranges available. Between this time range... and this time range Granularity of collected data data age ≤ 8 days data age > 8 days ≤ 3 hours 1 minute 10 evenly spaced data points > 3 hour ≤ 6 hours 2 minutes > 6 hours ≤ 14 hours 5 minutes > 14 hours ≤ 24 hours 10 minutes > 1 day (24 hrs) ≤ 4 days (96 hrs) 30 minutes > 4 days ≤ 7 days 1 hour 1 hour > 7 days ≤ 3 weeks 3 hours 3 hours > 3 weeks ≤ 6 weeks 6 hours 6 hours > 6 weeks ≤ 9 weeks 12 hours 12 hours > 63 days 3 days 3 days When the start time for a requested time range is older than eight days, data has been aggregated or averaged to one hour periods due to the data aggregation schedule. This means that for any one hour period, only a single data value is available. Obtaining data at less than an hourly period in the time range would cause oversampling, resulting in duplicate values being returned. Returning only ten values prevents oversampling and presents a smoother chart, which eliminates a possibly misleading \"plateau\" effect. Controlling time period output Sometimes the output data's granularity may be too fine, or the time period for the data returned may be too short. To control this, include the period= parameter in the query command as the number of seconds you want each time period to report. Make sure your specifications follow New Relic's data aggregation schedules. Example #1: Following New Relic's table summarizing granularity of collected data, the following API call would normally return data in 30-minute periods, since the request is for 4 days (from=2018-02-13 and to=2018-02-17). By adding period=3600, the data will be returned as 60-minute periods. curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APPID/metrics/data.xml' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d'names[]=CPU/User+Time&from=2018-02-13T04:00:00+00:00&to=2018-02-17T04:00:00+00:00&period=3600' Copy You cannot specify a period smaller than the default for the time range you are requesting. For example: In the command example above, you can request 1-hour periods, since that is greater than the default (half hour) granularity for the time range. In the command example above, you cannot request 1-minute periods, since that is less than the default (half hour) granularity for the time range. Example #2: If you request a range > 7 days but ≤ 3 weeks, where the default period is 3 hours, you can specify periods such as 6, 12, or 24 hours. However, you cannot request 1-hour periods, because that is less than the default (3 hours). Data retention How long data is available depends on the data retention for specific types of data. Extracting non-existent metric timeslice data Situations may arise where non-existent metric names are requested. For example: The metric timeslice data has not been created for one application, but exists for another. When the same metric extraction query is used on both of these applications, it will not be located for one. The metric name was incorrectly specified. Important Metric values that have existed in the past, but are no longer collected, will return a zero value. A successful response will include a 200 status code and metadata about the request. The metadata will contain the names of the metrics requested and the status of the request for those names. Response Metadata Description Response Metric Data metrics_not_found Lists all metric names for which matching data was not found in the requested time period. Metric timeslice data will not be returned for these metrics metrics_found Lists all metric names for which matching data was found in the requested time period. Metric timeslice data will be returned for these metrics Here is an example of output for a valid metric name, HttpDispatcher.

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

      "body": "When metrics are reported to New Relic via the Metric API (including from integrations that use that API), the data is reported as the Metric data type and is available for querying. This document contains: How to view and query your metrics Example metric queries How to query multiple metrics with wildcards How to explore metric data Query APM metric timeslice data APM reports a specific type of data that we call metric timeslice data. For how to query that, see Query metric timeslice data. For information about other types of metrics, see Metric data types. View and query your metrics You can use NRQL to query your metric data in the New Relic One query builder or using our NerdGraph API. To query a metric, use the following query format: FROM Metric SELECT function(metric_name) WHERE attribute=value FACET attribute TIMESERIES Copy Below are the functions supported for each metric type: Metric type Supported functions Summary count, sum, min, max, and average Count sum Gauge count, sum, min, max, average, and latest Add the names of the metrics you want to chart with the appropriate value functions in the SELECT clause. The WHERE and FACET clauses can be used with attribute values. Remember to include the keyword TIMESERIES if you want to chart the data. This example demonstrates how you could chart the CPU usage in seconds for cluster foo . This query breaks down CPU usage by container, given a count metric named container_cpu_usage_seconds_total with the attributes containerName and clusterName: FROM Metric select sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy If you want the CPU usage per minute (the rate of change), then you can add the rate function to the query above. FROM Metric select rate(sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), 1 minute) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy View example metric queries The previous examples demonstrate basic forms of metric queries, but NRQL can also be used to chart, explore, and analyze metric data. Chart multiple metrics Chart multiple metrics using a single query by providing a comma-separated list of metrics in the SELECT clause. For example, to chart the memory usage for a container along with the memory limit metric, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes), latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Perform mathematical operations on metric data Perform math operations on one or more metrics to compute a new, derived metric. To monitor available memory, you can calculate the percentage of available memory from the two metrics used in the previous example: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(container_memory_usage_bytes)) / latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) * 100 AS '% Memory Available' WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Use filters to select specific time series In addition to using a WHERE clause which applies to everything in SELECT, NRQL provides another aggregation function called filter which can be used to select a specific time series to be charted or operated on. The following example charts a memory usage metric labeled \"Total (k8s)\" which is computed by adding together the memory usage of two specific containers within a pod: FROM Metric SELECT filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'discovery') + filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'istio-proxy') AS 'Total (k8s)' WHERE clusterName = 'my-cluster' AND podName LIKE 'istio-pilot-%' TIMESERIES Copy View the raw metric data points When querying metric data using FROM Metric, New Relic automatically selects the specific aggregate to use in the query, depending on the length of the query window and any bucket size specified as an argument to the TIMESERIES keyword. This ensures efficient querying and chart resolution. If you want to override this behavior to view or operate on the raw metric data points, use the optional RAW keyword in your query. When querying these raw metric data points, there is a query time window limit of 48 hours. Any query attempting to access more than 48 hours of raw metric data will result in a query error. This example shows how to list the last 20 data points received for a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'container_fs_usage_bytes' LIMIT 20 RAW Copy Query multiple metrics with wildcards Wildcards are represented in NRQL by the % character. If you want to query multiple metrics that use a standard naming convention, you can use the wildcard feature to return results for all of them without having to specify each metric name individually. Wildcards can help you: Aggregate metrics together and chart the results FACET results by metric name in a chart Find and chart all metrics matching a given naming convention Wildcards are particularly helpful if you later add new metrics matching an existing naming convention. By using % instead of writing out each metric name in your query, you won't have to rewrite the query when you add new metrics. Let's say you have multiple algorithms that perform a similar task. You can define the following metrics, which show the duration of the different algorithms: myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm2.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm3.duration If used in a query, myNeatProcess.%.duration will return results for all three of the algorithms above. If you later create new algorithms named algorithm4, algorithm5, and algorithm6, the same query will return results for all six algorithms. Chart multiple metrics with wildcards You can chart multiple metrics using a single query by using wildcards (%) in the SELECT clause. For example, to query all the algorithms in the example above and plot a line on the chart for each algorithm's average duration, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) FACET metricName TIMESERIES Copy Perform mathematical operations on metric data with wildcards You can also use wildcards to perform math operations on multiple metrics and compute a new metric. You can calculate the mean duration for all algorithms listed in the example above: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy You can calculate what percentage of overall runtime a single algorithm takes: FROM Metric SELECT myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration / sum(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy Return results for invidual fields using getField() Metrics have multiple fields associated with them, and each field contains its own unique values. If you would like to extract one of those values using a query, you can do that with getField(). For example, if you want to use a single value within a metric to do a comparison in a WHERE clause, you can use getField(metricName, field) or metricName[field]. List of gauge metrics This example query returns a list of gauge metrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE %[type] = 'gauge' Copy List all metric names for a particular host The average value of a metric is computed as total over count, so the following query returns metric data where the result of the average() value function is greater than 2. FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND apm.service.transaction.duration[total] / apm.service.transaction.duration[count] > 2 Copy Explore metric data The NRQL keyset and uniques functions can be used together with the metricName attribute (available on all metrics) to perform tasks like listing all the available metrics in your account or discovering the attributes available on a particular metric. List all metric names in an account FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy List all metric names for a particular host FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE hostname = 'host1.mycompany.com' Copy Show the attribute keys for a specific metric FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = METRIC_NAME Copy",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Want to try out our StatsD integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need a license key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query of the NrIntegrationError event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic license key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. Learn how to browse and query data in New Relic. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute.

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Want to know more? Here are a few recommendations for what to do next: Learn about NRDB's data model and flexible schema in our blog post and white paper. Get to know NRQL, our query language, with our Syntax, clauses, and functions page, or read about some of our favorite NRQL capabilities. Read about our query builder, which supports NRQL and PromQL-style queries. Check out UI options for dashboards and charting.",

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues.

Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Problem When using service maps, you can't view the full set of entities or the relationships between entities that you expect to see. Solution Make sure that the entities are being monitored with an agent. If you have a mix of agents with some having distributed tracing turned on and some having it turned off, you will not see the relations between those agents. The solution for this scenario is to run all agents either with distributed tracing turned on (preferred) or turn it off for all agents. If this does not remedy the issue, the service you're trying to view may require manual instrumentation. When you view applications and services that we automatically instrument in service maps, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some of these services or applications are missing from service maps. Tip Some browser apps are exceptions to this, and may be missing because: Relationships for copy and paste browser agents are not detected. Only the relationships for injected browser agents is shown (the app the agent is injected into). Call relationships (for example, AJAX calling to other apps) are not displayed. If services or apps are missing, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application.",

Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",
