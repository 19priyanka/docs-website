      "body": "Browser monitoring's JavaScript snippet introduces a nearly invisible impact on website performance and user perception of the time it takes a page to load. The JavaScript is included in a packet of webpage data that is sent anyway. In addition, it immediately begins monitoring for errors and events as the rest of the webpage executes. The negligible amount of overhead required to load the JavaScript results in a significant return of actionable data. Contents Overall impact The JavaScript's overhead takes into consideration both the impact on the user and the impact on your systems' performance: User perception: Typically users cannot detect performance degradations on a website of less than 200ms. Browser's JavaScript adds less than 15ms in aggregated time per page load. This is split up over time, so at no point would a user be able to perceive any performance impact due to the JavaScript. Webserver and systems: Browser app monitoring occurs on the user's browser, not on the server. Processing time does not have an impact on your CPU consumption. In addition, we take additional steps to minimize any potential impact on the apps and webpages being monitored. For example, the \"loader\" script is loaded synchronously in the <HEAD> in order to ensure monitoring is enabled for the entire life cycle of the page. This script is included inline, which eliminates the need for another roundtrip network request to a content delivery network (CDN). The \"loader\" comes with the initial page load. Later in the life cycle of the page, New Relic loads an additional monitoring script asynchronously. This script should not have any perceivable effect to the user and is included in the overall overhead of less than 15ms per page. Network impact Browser monitoring also minimizes network traffic for the end user by aggregating data locally (in the client) and sending it back to New Relic on load, at periodic intervals, on unload, or when data has been collected. (During the browser session's idle periods, transmissions may not be required.)

      "body": "Browser monitoring places a small \"loader\" script into the head section of each page on a monitored site. This JavaScript instrumentation has been designed to: Provide maximum visibility into front-end performance, accurately time how long it takes for pages to load in all browsers, and to report details for JavaScript errors and AJAX calls. Have minimal impact on overall page load time and search engine optimization (SEO), including search engine ranking, indexing, crawl efficiency, or other SEO-related concerns. Contents Efficiency of inline JavaScript The most effective method for browser monitoring is to include a minimal amount of JavaScript instrumentation code inline in the head of the monitored page. This code then retrieves the remainder of the necessary code after the page finishes loading. Other browser monitoring methods include JavaScript code at the end of the page body or exclusively using an external script. However, these methods can limit visibility into the end users' experience. Impact on SEO Performance testing results indicate that using browser monitoring's JavaScript has a negligible effect on page load time. In addition, it has no negative impact on how users or search engines interact with your site. Google's consistent recommendation to website owners is to build a site that is valuable to users and accessible to search engine crawlers. Google rankings favor sites that provide the most relevant information and the best user experience. Browser monitoring can help you improve user experience by identifying performance bottlenecks, including: Slow page loads Problematic JavaScript errors Long AJAX calls Identifying Javascript errors is especially helpful because Google's bots are increasingly running the JavaScript code on websites they crawl in order to access content provided by AJAX-heavy web applications. A JavaScript error that previously was only visible to human users (for example, a broken button) could affect whether the Google bots can successfully interact with your site. We understand that SEO and traffic referred by search engines are critically important to many businesses. When used effectively, browser monitoring can even increase a site's ranking in Google and other search engines by improving performance and user experience.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ...

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring.

      "body": "New Relic browser monitoring has a single-page application (SPA) monitoring feature that provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real user interactions with single-page apps, and for any app that uses AJAX requests. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, our SPA API allows you to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring SPA monitoring is enabled by default for new browser agent installations. The SPA-enabled version of the agent gives access to other powerful New Relic features, like distributed tracing. For more information, see Enable browser monitoring. For compatability information for SPA-related features, see SPA requirements. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by browser monitoring includes: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal throughout 2021 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal throughout 2021 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

For example, to see only page loads and route changes that occurred on browsers in the city of Portland, Oregon, select Filter > City > Portland. Group SPA views You can use the Group page by dropdown to group the list of page views by any attribute. For example, if you want to compare the average response times by browser type, select Group page by > userAgent. The combination of filtering and grouping lets you quickly find very specific data. For example, to compare how a specific URL is loading on different browsers: From the Filter dropdown, select targetURL, then select the URL you want to study. From the Group page by dropdown, select userAgent. SPA view details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > (select a view): Select a view from the list to see assorted details and breakdowns. Select an individual page load or route change to see details. Selecting either will provide a breakdown of where time was spent for a browser interaction, and display that data over a time series matching the window selected in the time picker. Every route change view can theoretically also be an initial page load. (For example, when a route change URL is sent to someone else and they load it, that will now be considered an initial page load to New Relic.) This is why the SPA view details page has charts for both initial page loads and route changes. This allows you to compare how a view performs as an initial page load to how its performance as a route change. There are three chart display options, selectable with the icons to the right of the Avg initial page load time chart title. The default display is the color-coded stacked area chart. You can also switch to a Histogram display or a percentile line graph. Also on the details page is a Throughput chart that combines initial page loads and route changes. The chart displays the 5 pages with the highest throughput, which are listed beneath the chart, and consolidates all other pages into Other. Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line shows when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by the browser agent without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal throughout 2021 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

      "body": "This document explains how browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

      "body": "This document explains how browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

This document explains the build tools and resources available for building an on-host integration with our Go language tools. Integrations tutorial Important The following tutorial is based on integrations using the SDK integration protocol v3. Find more information about the integration protocol v4 in the Github repository. The Go language integration-building tutorial on GitHub gives step-by-step procedures for building a Go language integration that reports Redis data. The tutorial shows how to build an integration using the Linux command line, but you can use the same techniques for a Windows integration with a standard Go install and PowerShell. The make command will not work with PowerShell, but you can use the Go commands inside it as a guide for building your integration. Tip You can create an on-host integration in any language, but Go is the language New Relic uses for its own integrations and build tools. To create an integration in another language, adhere to the integration file structures and JSON output requirements. Go language integration building package The tutorial relies on a New Relic Go language integration-building library package, which provides a set of useful Go functions and data structures.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics cli_args: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory cli_args: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics cli_args: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory cli_args: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics cli_args: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory cli_args: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics cli_args: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory cli_args: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics cli_args: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory cli_args: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "Problem You created a custom New Relic Infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the Infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the Infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect. For information about the Go language logging package, see Logging package. For more help For logging for all New Relic agents, see New Relic agent logs and troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect. For information about the Go language logging package, see Logging package. For more help For logging for all New Relic agents, see New Relic agent logs and troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

For more help with configuration, see Ruby agent configuration. To set up Infinite Tracing, you need to install the Infinite Tracing gem. The gem is available in rubygems.org. For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile: gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing' Copy If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the recommended configuration, Rails will automatically call Bundler.require and cause newrelic-infinite_tracing to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing' or manually call Bundler.require.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report?

Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report?

Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Type Required configuration Infinite Tracing Configuration options: Configuration file (newrelic.yml): distributed_tracing: enabled: true infinite_tracing: trace_observer: host: 'YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST' Copy Environment variables: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Copy Step 4. (Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

Install the agent using easy_install/pip/distribute via the Python Package Index or download it directly from the New Relic download site. New Features Reservoir sizes now configurable using settings and environment variables Reservoir sizes for span events, transaction events, error events, and custom events are now configurable via environment variables. These reservoirs limit both the maximum number of events that can be sent as well as local memory usage. The agent reservoir can be expanded to accommodate more spans in case more traces are needed or there are dropped spans. The default setting for event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data has been increased from 1000 to 2000 for better performance. This variable can be increased up to a size of 10,000. These settings previously existed via config file but were undocumented. For details, see the new documentation. Deprecations Cross Application Tracing is now deprecated, and disabled by default Distributed Tracing is replacing Cross Application Tracing as the default means of tracing between services. Cross Application Tracing will soon be removed entirely with a future release. The default setting for cross_application_tracer.enabled is now False, disabling Cross Application Tracing. To continue using it temporarily while transitioning to Distributed Tracing, enable it with cross_application_tracer.enabled = True and distributed_tracing.enabled = False. Changes Distributed Tracing is enabled by default The default setting for distributed_tracing.enabled is now True, enabling Distributed Tracing by default. To disable Distributed Tracing, please set the distributed_tracing.enabled setting to False.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. With distributed tracing data, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues and fix them. Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests go from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request. Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace. Why it matters A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these. For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers: The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request. None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. What you can see in the New Relic UI After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data: What you can do Description Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Customize queries and dashboards You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards. See data across accounts See a global view of traces from across all your accounts and applications in New Relic One. Query traces programmatically Query distributed trace data by using GraphQL in our NerdGraph API explorer.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction.

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report?

Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data. Next steps Here are some additional steps to consider: Learn more about how distributed tracing works and the data structure. Decorate span data with custom attributes.

      "body": "If you're following the Enable distributed tracing procedures and want to set up Infinite Tracing, you'll need to set up a trace observer. A trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that decides what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest. Tip This documentation is for our Infinite Tracing feature. To learn about all our distributed tracing options, see Intro to distributed tracing. Set up the trace observer Before setting up a trace observer, understand these points: With the exception of the Trace API, these instructions are not standalone; they're part of larger enable procedures. If you're still figuring out what you need, see Enable distributed tracing. To avoid configuration conflict issues, you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services. If some services in a trace have our standard distributed tracing enabled, you should upgrade those to Infinite Tracing. To set up a trace observer: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Apps. Under Your apps, click New Relic Edge. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled. If no trace observers are already present, click New trace observer to add one, fill out the information, and click Create. Important Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, you’ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers. Under the Endpoints dropdown: Copy the For other integrations endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. If you're enabling a language agent, also copy the For language agents value and have it ready: this will be referred to as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our Trace API: this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works. Send sample payload Important If you're using Zipkin-format data, see Send Zipkin payload. This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named Test Service A. To send this sample request: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to and have it ready. Copy the following curl request into a text editor: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"environment\": \"staging\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"host\": \"host123.example.com\", \"name\": \"/home\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service B\" } } ] } ]' \\ '$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL' Copy Insert your own values into the curl request: Value Description $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Replace this with your license key. $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL Replace this with the For other integrations endpoint value you copied in a previous step. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it. The test should return HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues: Confirm that you used the For other integrations endpoint value. Confirm you're using single quotes around YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Check that you're using the correct API key. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A (here's a link for that query). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to show up in the UI. (Optional) There are several ways to configure Infinite Tracing. This configuration can wait until after you've completed the enable procedures. This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling: Language agents Third-party telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus, others) Trace API: once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application. Trace observer endpoints In the trace observer UI, there's an Endpoints dropdown. When setting up the trace observer, we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values: For language agents: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST. This is used for configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer. For other integrations: This value is referenced in our code examples as YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. This is used for configuring our telemetry integrations and for sending data via the Trace API (including sending sample payloads).",

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute.

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send traces in our general format, aka new-relic format. (To send Zipkin-format data, see Zipkin.) Get started Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, our new-relic format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send Zipkin-format trace data to our Trace API. (For our general data format, see New Relic format.) Zipkin version requirements The Trace API supports data from Zipkin JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see Zipkin v2 release details and the Zipkin v2 schema. Overview of using the Trace API Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, zipkin format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint Our send-data instructions have options for enabling Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, choose an option: Send a sample trace: This shows a curl example of sending a trace to New Relic. This is useful for understanding how the Trace API works, and to verify you're seeing data in New Relic. Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation: if you have an existing Zipkin implementation, you can simply change the endpoint of where your data gets sent. Send sample Zipkin trace payload This section describes how to send a simple Zipkin-format trace to our Trace API via curl request. You might choose to do this in order to learn how our API works and to verify that data is showing up in New Relic before doing in-depth instrumentation. To get started sending a sample payload: (Optional, to enable Infinite Tracing) First, you must set up a trace observer. That procedure includes instructions for sending a sample trace using our general new-relic format. When you get to that step, return here to instead learn how to send a Zipkin-format trace. Send a Zipkin-format payload following the instructions below. Send Zipkin-format payload To send a sample Zipkin-format trace: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. You'll be executing a curl request, below. Notes on this: Replace the license key placeholder with your license key. If you're using Infinite Tracing, use the YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value in place of the standard endpoint. If you want to send more than one post, change the trace ID to a different value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same traceId may result in fragmented traces in the UI. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 2' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"id\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"post\", \"duration\": 508068, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-1\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { } }, { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"parentId\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"id\": \"asdf9asdn123lkasdf\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"service 2 span\", \"duration\": 2019, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-2\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\" } } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Within a minute, the trace should be available in the our distributed tracing UI. To find it, run a query for the trace.id. In this example, it was test-zipkin-trace-id-1. Note that you search by the transformed attribute of trace.id (not traceId). To learn more: Learn where Trace API data shows up in the UI. Send data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation. Learn how to decorate spans by adding tags. This helps you customize how traces are displayed in our UI for a richer, more helpful experience. Learn about general endpoint information (data limits, required metadata, and response validation). Learn about how Zipkin data is transformed and stored in our format. If you don't see your trace data, see Troubleshooting. Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation Preliminary notes: If you want to enable Infinite Tracing, you first must set up a trace observer. It can be helpful to first send a sample payload to verify things are working properly. To report data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation, you'll point the Zipkin tracer at the appropriate Trace API endpoint with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers). Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin OkHttpSender in Java configured for the Trace API: OkHttpSender.create(\"https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2\"); Copy Note that if you were using Infinite Tracing, or had an EU-region New Relic account, the endpoint would be different. For an explanation of Api-Key and the other metadata, see Request metadata. Transformation of Zipkin data To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic attribute naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see How distributed tracing works. Zipkin tag Stored in New Relic as... Details traceId trace.id Unique identifier for a trace. id id Unique identifier for a span. parentId parent.id Identifier of the upstream span that called the service. kind kind Either Client or Server. name name Name of span. duration duration.ms Zipkin v2 spans must have durations specified in microseconds, and will be converted to milliseconds. localEndpoint: serviceName service.name We use the Zipkin v2 service name to identify the entity that created this span. localEndpoint: port localEndpoint.port All values in the localEndpoint object will be flattened to a span attribute called localEndpoint.key tags reported as attributes Key:value pairs in the tags object in Zipkin v2 will be written as span attributes. annotations not supported We do not currently support annotations in the Trace API. Spans will not be rejected if they contain annotations, but the annotations data will not be written. Add other tags/attributes You can add any tags you want to the tags block, with the exception of the restricted tags. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic attributes.

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI.

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send traces in our general format, aka new-relic format. (To send Zipkin-format data, see Zipkin.) Get started Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, our new-relic format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send traces in our general format, aka new-relic format. (To send Zipkin-format data, see Zipkin.) Get started Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, our new-relic format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

(For our general data format, see New Relic format.) Zipkin version requirements The Trace API supports data from Zipkin JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see Zipkin v2 release details and the Zipkin v2 schema. Overview of using the Trace API Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, zipkin format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint Our send-data instructions have options for enabling Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, choose an option: Send a sample trace: This shows a curl example of sending a trace to New Relic. This is useful for understanding how the Trace API works, and to verify you're seeing data in New Relic. Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation: if you have an existing Zipkin implementation, you can simply change the endpoint of where your data gets sent. Send sample Zipkin trace payload This section describes how to send a simple Zipkin-format trace to our Trace API via curl request. You might choose to do this in order to learn how our API works and to verify that data is showing up in New Relic before doing in-depth instrumentation. To get started sending a sample payload: (Optional, to enable Infinite Tracing) First, you must set up a trace observer. That procedure includes instructions for sending a sample trace using our general new-relic format. When you get to that step, return here to instead learn how to send a Zipkin-format trace. Send a Zipkin-format payload following the instructions below. Send Zipkin-format payload To send a sample Zipkin-format trace: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. You'll be executing a curl request, below. Notes on this: Replace the license key placeholder with your license key. If you're using Infinite Tracing, use the YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value in place of the standard endpoint. If you want to send more than one post, change the trace ID to a different value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same traceId may result in fragmented traces in the UI. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 2' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"id\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"post\", \"duration\": 508068, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-1\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { } }, { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"parentId\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"id\": \"asdf9asdn123lkasdf\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"service 2 span\", \"duration\": 2019, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-2\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\" } } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Within a minute, the trace should be available in the our distributed tracing UI. To find it, run a query for the trace.id. In this example, it was test-zipkin-trace-id-1. Note that you search by the transformed attribute of trace.id (not traceId). To learn more: Learn where Trace API data shows up in the UI. Send data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation. Learn how to decorate spans by adding tags. This helps you customize how traces are displayed in our UI for a richer, more helpful experience. Learn about general endpoint information (data limits, required metadata, and response validation). Learn about how Zipkin data is transformed and stored in our format. If you don't see your trace data, see Troubleshooting. Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation Preliminary notes: If you want to enable Infinite Tracing, you first must set up a trace observer. It can be helpful to first send a sample payload to verify things are working properly. To report data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation, you'll point the Zipkin tracer at the appropriate Trace API endpoint with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers). Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin OkHttpSender in Java configured for the Trace API: OkHttpSender.create(\"https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2\"); Copy Note that if you were using Infinite Tracing, or had an EU-region New Relic account, the endpoint would be different. For an explanation of Api-Key and the other metadata, see Request metadata. Transformation of Zipkin data To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic attribute naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see How distributed tracing works. Zipkin tag Stored in New Relic as... Details traceId trace.id Unique identifier for a trace. id id Unique identifier for a span. parentId parent.id Identifier of the upstream span that called the service. kind kind Either Client or Server. name name Name of span. duration duration.ms Zipkin v2 spans must have durations specified in microseconds, and will be converted to milliseconds. localEndpoint: serviceName service.name We use the Zipkin v2 service name to identify the entity that created this span. localEndpoint: port localEndpoint.port All values in the localEndpoint object will be flattened to a span attribute called localEndpoint.key tags reported as attributes Key:value pairs in the tags object in Zipkin v2 will be written as span attributes. annotations not supported We do not currently support annotations in the Trace API. Spans will not be rejected if they contain annotations, but the annotations data will not be written. Add other tags/attributes You can add any tags you want to the tags block, with the exception of the restricted tags. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic attributes.

Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

(For our general data format, see New Relic format.) Zipkin version requirements The Trace API supports data from Zipkin JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see Zipkin v2 release details and the Zipkin v2 schema. Overview of using the Trace API Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, zipkin format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint Our send-data instructions have options for enabling Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, choose an option: Send a sample trace: This shows a curl example of sending a trace to New Relic. This is useful for understanding how the Trace API works, and to verify you're seeing data in New Relic. Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation: if you have an existing Zipkin implementation, you can simply change the endpoint of where your data gets sent. Send sample Zipkin trace payload This section describes how to send a simple Zipkin-format trace to our Trace API via curl request. You might choose to do this in order to learn how our API works and to verify that data is showing up in New Relic before doing in-depth instrumentation. To get started sending a sample payload: (Optional, to enable Infinite Tracing) First, you must set up a trace observer. That procedure includes instructions for sending a sample trace using our general new-relic format. When you get to that step, return here to instead learn how to send a Zipkin-format trace. Send a Zipkin-format payload following the instructions below. Send Zipkin-format payload To send a sample Zipkin-format trace: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. You'll be executing a curl request, below. Notes on this: Replace the license key placeholder with your license key. If you're using Infinite Tracing, use the YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value in place of the standard endpoint. If you want to send more than one post, change the trace ID to a different value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same traceId may result in fragmented traces in the UI. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 2' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"id\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"post\", \"duration\": 508068, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-1\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { } }, { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"parentId\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"id\": \"asdf9asdn123lkasdf\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"service 2 span\", \"duration\": 2019, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-2\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\" } } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Within a minute, the trace should be available in the our distributed tracing UI. To find it, run a query for the trace.id. In this example, it was test-zipkin-trace-id-1. Note that you search by the transformed attribute of trace.id (not traceId). To learn more: Learn where Trace API data shows up in the UI. Send data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation. Learn how to decorate spans by adding tags. This helps you customize how traces are displayed in our UI for a richer, more helpful experience. Learn about general endpoint information (data limits, required metadata, and response validation). Learn about how Zipkin data is transformed and stored in our format. If you don't see your trace data, see Troubleshooting. Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation Preliminary notes: If you want to enable Infinite Tracing, you first must set up a trace observer. It can be helpful to first send a sample payload to verify things are working properly. To report data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation, you'll point the Zipkin tracer at the appropriate Trace API endpoint with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers). Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin OkHttpSender in Java configured for the Trace API: OkHttpSender.create(\"https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2\"); Copy Note that if you were using Infinite Tracing, or had an EU-region New Relic account, the endpoint would be different. For an explanation of Api-Key and the other metadata, see Request metadata. Transformation of Zipkin data To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic attribute naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see How distributed tracing works. Zipkin tag Stored in New Relic as... Details traceId trace.id Unique identifier for a trace. id id Unique identifier for a span. parentId parent.id Identifier of the upstream span that called the service. kind kind Either Client or Server. name name Name of span. duration duration.ms Zipkin v2 spans must have durations specified in microseconds, and will be converted to milliseconds. localEndpoint: serviceName service.name We use the Zipkin v2 service name to identify the entity that created this span. localEndpoint: port localEndpoint.port All values in the localEndpoint object will be flattened to a span attribute called localEndpoint.key tags reported as attributes Key:value pairs in the tags object in Zipkin v2 will be written as span attributes. annotations not supported We do not currently support annotations in the Trace API. Spans will not be rejected if they contain annotations, but the annotations data will not be written. Add other tags/attributes You can add any tags you want to the tags block, with the exception of the restricted tags. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic attributes.

No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report?

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our Trace API is used to send distributed tracing data to New Relic: either in our own generic format or the Zipkin data format. This API is also how trace data from some of our integrations and exporters is reported to New Relic. Want to try out the Trace API? Make sure you've created a free New Relic account. No credit card required. To skip some introductory content and get started quickly, go to Start reporting data. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see a map of services (if available), and a \"waterfall\" display of that trace's spans. When you select a trace from the list of traces, you see details about it. Trace map If a trace involves more than one entity, and we have information about those entities, the trace page includes a map. For more about how that, see Maps in context. Span properties The UI indicates span properties with these icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an error is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span error within the scope of that span This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in errors An error that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the error is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an error is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. OpenTelemetry Errors The Error Details box of the right pane is populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and displays the content of otel.status_description. Tip OpenTelemetry span events handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. You can view span event exceptions and non-exceptions by clicking View span events in the right pane. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: APM: C APM: Golang APM: Java APM: .NET APM: Node.js APM: PHP APM: Python APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9.

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring. Next steps: Enable and use Lambda monitoring To get started using our Lambda monitoring, see the installation and enablement instructions. To better understand how Lambda monitoring works, read about the New Relic Lambda monitoring stack. You can also set up alerts or add your own custom events or attributes.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample.

No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are monitoring a filter set and notice a problem, you do not need to recreate those criteria from New Relic Alerts. Instead, you can immediately select your filter set and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you are viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment. Any alert violations will be created per entity within the filter set. Create alert conditions for infrastructure Alert conditions apply to alert policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to use other types of notification channels, create a new policy from within the Alerts UI. Important The Infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit. To add an infrastructure alert condition to an alerts policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, then select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Type a meaningful condition name. Select the Alert type, or refer to the examples to decide which type to select. Create individual filters, or copy all the filters from a filter set to identify the hosts that you want the alert condition to use. Important For more information about the rules behind filters, see Filter set logic. Define the Critical (required) and Warning (optional, if available) thresholds for triggering the alert notification. Optional: To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the Enabled checkbox option. Select an existing policy for the new condition. OR Select the option to create a new policy and identify the email for alert notifications. Optional: Add a runbook url. Optional: Set Violation time limit for violations (this defaults to 24 hours). Select Create. Important If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a \"silent attribute,\" and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the API to create alert conditions for silent attributes. Other infrastructure alert condition methods You can also use these other methods to create an infrastructure alert condition: Use the Alerts UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Alerts > Alert policies > New alert policy > Create new condition, then select Infrastructure as the product. Use the Infrastructure UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Use infrastructure settings for integrations Tip Use this method to create an alert condition for infrastructure integrations. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts, and then click Create alert condition. Name and describe the alert condition. Click the Integrations alert type, and then select the integration data source you'd like to use. Use the Filter entities dropdown to limit your condition to specific attributes. Use the Define thresholds dropdowns to define your condition's thresholds, and then click Create. The configuration settings are optional. You can always update them later. View host alert events Anyone included in the policy's notification channels receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view Infrastructure alert incidents and individual violations through the user interface. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. To change the hosts or time frame, use the search window, Filter set, or Time functions. From the Events list, select the alert violation. To view detailed information in Alerts about the selected violation, select the link. Update or delete host alert information To edit, disable (or re-enable), or delete host alert information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Use the search window or Select all checkbox to locate one or more alert conditions. Select any of the available functions to edit, disable, enable, or delete the selected conditions. Use New Relic Alerts to monitor your entire infrastructure New Relic Alerts provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across all of your New Relic products. This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities that you care about the most, such as Docker containers, JVMs, and more. Alert features Features in Infrastructure Alert conditions Create: Use the Infrastructure UI. View, change, disable (or re-enable), or delete: Use the Infrastructure Settings > Alerts UI. Information on alerts View summary information about events: Use the Infrastructure Events UI. View detailed information about alert incidents or individual violations: Use the Alerts UI or the notification channel integrated with the associated policy. Alert policies View, add, change, disable, or delete: For policies with a variety of notification channels: Use the Alerts UI. For policies only needing email notifications: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Create a new policy, and add one or more email addresses as needed. Add host conditions to an existing policy: Use the Infrastructure UI. Notification channels To view, add, change, or delete available notification options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Search for the condition or policy name. From the list of conditions, select the policy link to view notification channel information in the Alerts UI. Add a description The use of the Description field is available for these alert condition types: NRQL conditions: add a description using the NerdGraph API. Infrastructure conditions: add a description using the UI or the REST API. The text you place in an alert condition's Description field is passed downstream to associated violations and notifications. A description can be used for several purposes, including: Capturing the reason for the alert condition. Defining the signal being monitored. Defining next steps. Add metadata to downstream systems. You can use template substitution to insert values from the attributes in the associated violation event. The template format is {{attributeName}}. For the attributes you can use when creating a description, see Violation event attributes. One available attribute is the special {{tag.*}} attribute. This attribute prefix is used to access any of the tag values that are included with the target signal, or any of the entity tags that are associated with the target signal. If there are entity tags associated with your violation, then they can be accessed using the entity tag name. An example of this would be {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}. When entity tags are available to use, you see them included with the violation, and displayed when you view the violations in an incident. This field has a maximum character size of 4,000. Add or edit a runbook URL The alert condition creation process includes an option for setting a URL for runbook instructions. This lets you link to information or standard procedures for handling a violation. Before adding or updating the link, make sure you use a valid URL. To add, update, or delete an alert condition's runbook URL: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the Runbook URL link. Save the condition. In order to be saved, the URL must be a valid URL. Violation time limit for violations The violation time limit allows you to define a time period after which violations will be force-closed. By default, violation time limit is 24 hours. To add or update an alert condition's violation time limit: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the violation time limit. Save the condition. Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and NRQL queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex NRQL query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed. To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example: Problem Solution Hosts If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts. Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting prod-host-01, prod-host-02, and prod-host-03, just target all hosts with prod-host-0 in the name. Entities Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target. Create custom attributes for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. The no_trigger_on field is optional. When set to [\"shutdown\"] this enables the Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown infrastructure condition option. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12, \"no_trigger_on\": [\"shutdown\"] } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: All conditions: 24 hours When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process is running too many instances on one host This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences.

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta NGINX monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The Azure Resources Manager (ARM) template provided by New Relic One helps you: Set up Azure to forward logs from EventHub to New Relic One. Set up Azure Activity Logs forwarding to New Relic One through EventHub. The setup process is almost the same for both use cases, but take a look at step 9 if you want to forward Azure Activity Logs to New Relic. On the other hand, the template is idempotent. You can start forwarding logs from EventHub and then re-run the same template to configure Azure Activity Logs forwarding by completing step 9 listed below. Requirements A New Relic license key.

We can also configure the activity logs to be forwarded, but there isn't a default log forwarding from your Azure resources. If you want to forward logs from any resource that produces them, you need to configure it by creating a diagnostic setting for the given resource. As an example, if you have a function running on Azure and you want to forward the logs to New Relic One, you'll need to configure a diagnostic setting to forward the logs to the configure EventHub. Read how to create diagnostic settings to send platform logs and metrics to different destinations. Azure Activity Logs Activating the Azure Activity Logs forwarding is optional and it provides: More visibility of your Azure resources Activity of the Azure resources Information about performed actions Events and their timestamps The user who performed an action, if applicable These logs allow your company to have more control over the resources, be aware of wrong or unintentional changes on your resources and even unexpected actions.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install.

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Connect AWS to New Relic Important AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in New Relic's CloudWatch solution and AWS CloudWatch blog posts. Follow the steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics. To connect additional API Polling integrations: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Click on one of the available service tiles. From the IAM console, click Create role, then click Another AWS account. For Account ID, use 754728514883. Check the Require external ID box. For External ID, enter your New Relic account ID. Do not enable the setting to Require MFA (multi-factor authentication). Attach the Policy: Search for ReadOnlyAccess, select the checkbox for the policy named ReadOnlyAccess, then click Next: Review. Alternatively, you can create your own managed policy and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor. For the Role name, enter NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations, then click Create role. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the Role summary page, select and copy the entire Role ARN (required later in this procedure). Configure a Budgets policy: While viewing the Role summary for your new role, select Add inline policy. Create a Custom policy: Enter a policy name (for example, NewRelicBudget), add the following permission statement, and then select Apply policy. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"budgets:ViewBudget\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then Save. Connect multiple AWS integrations To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account: If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy. Follow the instructions to connect your Amazon account to New Relic . Provide the ARN that contains the ReadOnlyAccess policy. Once setup is complete, select the integrations you want to monitor: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Select the checkbox for each integration you want to monitor. Connect multiple AWS accounts By default, the Amazon EC2 AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to connect an AWS account for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic. Add or edit custom tags New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have custom tags as dimensions. For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the Add filter menu of the Filter sets sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed. Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings. Disconnect your AWS integrations You can disable one or more integrations anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you do not disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic. To uninstall your services completely from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account. Regional support China regions are not supported.",

If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Alternatively, you can add the hostStatus: shutdown tag to your host along with checking the option mentioned above. This will stop all Host Not Reporting violations from opening for that host, as long as that tag is on it, regardless of agent version or OS. Removing the tag will allow the system to open Host Not Reporting violations for that host again. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned.

Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

If you find this message, edit your /etc/sudoers file with the visudo command and comment or remove the following line: Defaults requiretty Save and exit the file. Restart the newrelic-infra service. Review log permissions Check the agent's permission to open log_file. It's possible that the log file you are using was created when the agent was running as root, and now the nri-agent user does not have permissions to write it. To solve this, try one of these options: Change the owner of the log file. Change the log_file entry in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml configuration file.

You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes unless you use guided install. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings.

View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as image and operatingSystem. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker integration dashboard To open the Docker integration dashboard, click the Dashboard link above the data table. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: CPU: Used cores, kernel percentage Memory: Size limit, cache bytes I/O: Write count per second, total bytes Network: Errors per second, packets Process: Process count, restart count Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon.",

Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported.

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds. After this period metadata expires and the agent will fetch it again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_metadata_expiry_sec NRIA_CLOUD_METADATA_EXPIRY_SEC integer 300 1.2.6 cloud_retry_backoff_sec Sets the interval of time the agent waits between cloud detection retries in case that cloud detection failed, in seconds. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version container_cache_metadata_limit NRIA_CONTAINER_CACHE_METADATA_LIMIT integer 60 1.0.801 docker_api_version Specifies the Docker client API version. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version docker_api_version NRIA_DOCKER_API_VERSION string 1.24 1.1.4 File system variables custom_supported_file_systems List of the types of file systems that the agent supports. This value needs to be a subset of the default list, and items that are not in the default list will be discarded. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_all_plugins NRIA_DISABLE_ALL_PLUGINS boolean false 1.2.1 cloud_security_group_refresh_sec Sampling period for the CloudSecurityGroups plugin, in seconds.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL). Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent. Learn how to manage the agent.",

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent.

It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag.

This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME . Copy Run the container from the image you built with the required required run flags: docker run \\ -d \\ --name newrelic-infra \\ --network=host \\ --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \\ --privileged \\ --pid=host \\ -v \"/:/host:ro\" \\ -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" \\ YOUR_IMAGE_NAME Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next? Docker Compose Create a folder to store the configuration files: mkdir ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Change directory to the one you've just created: cd ~/newrelic-infra-setup Copy Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" > newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create the newrelic-infra.dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: touch newrelic-infra.dockerfile Copy vim newrelic-infra.dockerfile #you can use any text editor Copy Put the following content in the file: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Create docker-compose.yaml: touch docker-compose.yaml Copy vim docker-compose.yaml #you can use any text editor Copy Put following content in the file: version: '3' services: agent: container_name: newrelic-infra build: context: . dockerfile: newrelic-infra.dockerfile cap_add: - SYS_PTRACE network_mode: host pid: host privileged: true volumes: - \"/:/host:ro\" - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" restart: unless-stopped Copy Build and start docker-compose: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d Copy For potential next steps, like how to see data in the UI, see What's next?

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "The infrastructure monitoring agent for Linux supports Docker environments by default. If you're running a container OS or have restrictions that require deploying the agent as a container, you can run a containerized version of our infrastructure monitoring agent. This can monitor metrics for the container itself, as well as the underlying host. Using the custom (recommended) or basic setup allows the infrastructure agent to run inside a container environment. A host can only run one instance of the agent at a time, whether that's the containerized agent or the non-containerized version. What you need The containerized version of the infrastructure agent requires Docker 1.12 or higher. The container must run any of the Linux distributions and versions supported by our agent. The container image is available and supported on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. The log forwarder is not included with the containerized agent. We recommend installing the agent on the underlying host which provides all capabilities. Custom setup (recommended) The following are basic instructions for creating a custom Docker image on Linux. This allows you to deploy the infrastructure agent as a container that can monitor its underlying host. Recommendation: Extend the newrelic/infrastructure image, and use your own newrelic-infra.yml agent config file. Once your image is built, you can easily spin up a container without having to provide more launch time configurations. Do not provide secrets using environment variables with Docker. Docker CLI Create the newrelic-infra.yml agent config file with your New Relic license key. For config option explanations, see configuration settings. license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Create the Dockerfile extending the newrelic/infrastructure image, and add your config to /etc/newrelic-infra.yml: FROM newrelic/infrastructure:latest ADD newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy Build and tag your image: docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .

Required container privileges Due to resource isolation from the host and other containers via Linux namespaces, a container has a very restricted view and control of its underlying host's resources by default. Without these extra privileges, the infrastructure agent cannot monitor the host and its containers. The infrastructure agent collects data about its host using system files and system calls. For more information about how the infrastructure agent collects data, see our documentation about infrastructure monitoring and security. Required privileges include: Privilege Description --network=host Sets the container's network namespace to the host's network namespace. This allows the agent to collect the network metrics about the host. -v \"/:/host:ro\" Bind mounts the host's root volume to the container. This read-only access to the host's root allows the agent to collect process and storage metrics as well as Inventory data from the host. --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE Adds the Linux capability to trace system processes. This allows the agent to gather data about processes running on the host. Read more here. --privileged --pid=host -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\" Bind mounts the host's Docker daemon socket to the container. This allows the agent to connect to the Engine API via the Docker daemon socket to collect the host's container data. Next steps after install For next steps after install is completed, see What's next? Inventory collected Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors. The infrastructure agent collects this data for Linux systems running with containers. Category Source Data collected using metadata agent_config Agent's complete config file system uptime -s, /etc/redhat-release, /proc/cpuinfo, /etc/os-release, /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease, /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor, /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name Container data Once the infrastructure agent is running in a Docker container, it can collect the same host compute data and event data that the infrastructure agent is capable of collecting when running natively on a host. For more information, see our documentation about how to view your Docker container data. Containerized agent image The containerized agent image is built from an Alpine base image. A CentOS base image is also available. Alpine is used as the base image since version 0.0.55. This is the one pointed by latest tag. Earlier versions used CentOS 7 as base image. In order to keep using that legacy image, some backports may be included there. To fetch the latest CentOS 7 based image, point to the latest-centos tag. Check the source code This integration is open source software. You can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent.

It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.21 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent starts automatically after you run the installation script. However, there are situations where you may need to manually restart the agent (for example, after changing your agent configuration). Linux: Start, stop, restart, or check agent status For Linux, ensure you use the correct command for your init system. Select start, stop, restart, or status as appropriate: SystemD (Amazon Linux 2, SLES 12, CentOS 7 or higher, Debian 8 or higher, RHEL 7 or higher, Ubuntu 15.04 or higher): sudo systemctl <start|stop|restart|status> newrelic-infra Copy System V (Debian 7, SLES 11.4, RHEL 5): sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra <start|stop|restart|status> Copy Upstart (Amazon Linux, RHEL 6, Ubuntu 14.04 or lower): sudo initctl <start|stop|restart|status> newrelic-infra Copy Windows: Start, stop, restart, or check agent status Important To start, stop, or restart the agent, you must run cmd.exe or PowerShell as Administrator. For Windows Server, you can use the Windows command prompt or PowerShell. Command prompt (cmd.exe) Start or stop the Windows agent: net <start|stop> newrelic-infra Copy Restart the Windows agent: net stop newrelic-infra ; net start newrelic-infra Copy Check the status of the Windows agent: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"STATE\" Copy PowerShell Start or stop the Windows agent: Stop-Service -Name \"newrelic-infra\" Start-Service -Name \"newrelic-infra\" Copy You can also use net start|stop newrelic-infra Restart the Windows agent: Restart-Service newrelic-infra Copy Check status of Windows agent: (Get-Service newrelic-infra).Status Copy macOS: Start, stop, restart, or check agent status Stop or start the agent: brew services stop newrelic-infra-agent brew services start newrelic-infra-agent Copy Restart the agent: brew services restart newrelic-infra-agent Copy Check status of the agent: brew services list Copy Customize agent logs The infrastructure agent logs to a default location which depends on your platform.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version docker_api_version NRIA_DOCKER_API_VERSION string 1.24 1.1.4 File system variables custom_supported_file_systems List of the types of file systems that the agent supports. This value needs to be a subset of the default list, and items that are not in the default list will be discarded. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent.

It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default.

This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "With the infrastructure agent, you can monitor not only individual servers, but also understand how your service performs as a whole. The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds. After this period metadata expires and the agent will fetch it again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_metadata_expiry_sec NRIA_CLOUD_METADATA_EXPIRY_SEC integer 300 1.2.6 cloud_retry_backoff_sec Sets the interval of time the agent waits between cloud detection retries in case that cloud detection failed, in seconds. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version container_cache_metadata_limit NRIA_CONTAINER_CACHE_METADATA_LIMIT integer 60 1.0.801 docker_api_version Specifies the Docker client API version. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version docker_api_version NRIA_DOCKER_API_VERSION string 1.24 1.1.4 File system variables custom_supported_file_systems List of the types of file systems that the agent supports. This value needs to be a subset of the default list, and items that are not in the default list will be discarded. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_all_plugins NRIA_DISABLE_ALL_PLUGINS boolean false 1.2.1 cloud_security_group_refresh_sec Sampling period for the CloudSecurityGroups plugin, in seconds.

      "body": "With the infrastructure agent, you can monitor not only individual servers, but also understand how your service performs as a whole. The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. macOS: Manually install agent versions through HomeBrew. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds. After this period metadata expires and the agent will fetch it again.

If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Tip To install the infrastructure agent for the first time, see the installation documentation for Linux, Windows, or configuration management tools. To uninstall the infrastructure agent, see Uninstall the Infrastructure agent. View the infrastructure agent version The infrastructure agent does not update itself automatically. Check the infrastructure agent release notes to make sure you have the latest agent version. To view the current infrastructure agent version for a host, use any of these options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Agents > Agent version. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts > (select a host). Create a query for SystemSample. Update the agent for installs using the package manager If you used the default installation process, use your package manager to update the program and its dependencies to the latest version. Here are examples for some common systems: Update using apt ( Debian, Ubuntu) To manually update the infrastructure agent with apt-get: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade newrelic-infra -y Copy Update using yum ( Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL) To manually update the infrastructure agent with yum: sudo yum update newrelic-infra -y Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update using Zypper ( SLES) To manually update the infrastructure agent with Zypper: sudo zypper -n update newrelic-infra Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on Windows Server (32 bits) To manually update the infrastructure agent on Windows Server: Download the latest .MSI installer image from download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/386/newrelic-infra-386.msi Run the install script. To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra-386.msi Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on Windows Server (64 bits) To manually update the infrastructure agent on Windows Server: Download the latest .MSI installer image from download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/newrelic-infra.msi Run the install script. To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on macOS To manually update the infrastructure agent on macOS, open the terminal and run the following commands: Stop the service (if already running): brew services stop newrelic-infra-agent Copy Uninstall the agent: brew update newrelic-infrastructure Copy Update with config management tools To update the infrastructure agent using your configuration management tool, see the documentation for your tool: Configure with Ansible Configure with Chef Configure with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Configure with Puppet Update the agent for assisted and manual tarball installs Important Since there are are no automated scripts, old files may remain when you update. Be sure to manually remove outdated files. To update the agent, download the file again and follow the installation procedure for Linux (assisted or manual) or Windows (assisted or manual). This will overwrite your old installation. Update the containerized version of the agent Use the latest label to ensure that our Docker image is automatically updated. Identify outdated agent versions from the UI You can use the Infrastructure monitoring UI to search for outdated agent versions: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory * * * * . In the search bar, type newrelic-infra. Select a group's dropdown to see the agent versions for that group. To manually check the infrastructure agent versions, you can log onto a server and run newrelic-infra --version, or the applicable command for your package manager.",

From your Edit GCP account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all GCP integrations To disconnect your GCP account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your GCP account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that GCP account. If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions.

Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "Uninstalling the infrastructure agent does not directly affect any of your infrastructure Integrations: if you uninstall the agent, your integrations will remain. Similarly, if you disable or uninstall your integrations, the infrastructure agent will remain. To uninstall any of your integrations, follow the procedure corresponding to the type of integration. Cloud integrations AWS You can disable infrastructure AWS integrations and still retain the connection between your AWS account and New Relic. We recommend not to disable your EC2 and EBS integrations because those add important metadata to your infrastructure data. If you want to... Do this Disable one or more AWS service integrations To disable services while keeping your AWS account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all AWS integrations To disconnect your AWS account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your AWS account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that AWS account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to AWS and select Services > IAM > Roles. Select the checkbox for the role you want to delete, then select Role Actions > Delete Role. Unlinking your AWS account will disable the trust relationship set up via your ARN. Azure If you want to... Do this Disable one or more Azure service integrations To disable services while keeping your Azure account linked to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all Azure integrations To disconnect your Azure account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your Azure account. This requires being either the user who registered the app or an administrator. This procedure will disable all New Relic integrations associated with that Azure account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to Azure and go into All Services > Identity > App registrations, or go to Azure Active Directory service and select App registrations. Find the registered app (the recommended name is NewRelic-Integrations). To see the full list of available apps, select the dropdown menu beside the search field and select All apps. Select the app and, on the panel that opens, select Delete. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) If you want to... Do this Disable one or more GCP service integrations To disable services while keeping your GCP account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all GCP integrations To disconnect your GCP account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your GCP account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that GCP account. If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions. Here are some examples: Apache Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-apache yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-apache zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-apache Cassandra Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-cassandra yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-cassandra zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-cassandra Kubernetes Each cluster will have a single node where kubectl is running. To uninstall the Kubernetes integration, use the following command on each of these nodes: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy MySQL Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-mysql yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-mysql zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-mysql NGINX Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-nginx yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-nginx zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-nginx Redis Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-redis yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-redis zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-redis StatsD cd /path/to/statsd npm uninstall @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend From the StatsD config.js, remove the \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" entry from the list of backends. Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions. To replicate the integrations package, you will need to install all the available integrations again.",

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Before installation, make sure to check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. See our docs for more information. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Once it's unpacked, access and edit the installation PowerShell script installer.ps1. Update your license key. Optional: Update any other parameters. Execute installer.ps1 with admin rights. Configure your installation Important Make sure any custom folder defined in the installation settings has permissions limitations properly defined. The infrastructure agent might execute any integration defined in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR directory with Administrator permissions.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds. After this period metadata expires and the agent will fetch it again.

If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version docker_api_version NRIA_DOCKER_API_VERSION string 1.24 1.1.4 File system variables custom_supported_file_systems List of the types of file systems that the agent supports. This value needs to be a subset of the default list, and items that are not in the default list will be discarded. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation, and place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation: you are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. See our docs for more information. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The Infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, placed in the same folder with the agent, to configure the agent's behavior. You can create a new config file based on config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The Infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. Additionally, the agent uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

This method gives you full control of the installation: you are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. See our docs for more information. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The Infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, placed in the same folder with the agent, to configure the agent's behavior. You can create a new config file based on config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The Infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. Additionally, the agent uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next?

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds.

If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",
