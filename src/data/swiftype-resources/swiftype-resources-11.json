      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL cloud integrations API tutorial.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

We have two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud integrations and on-host integrations. These are described in more detail below. Cloud integrations Our cloud integrations collect data from cloud platform services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations and they do not require the use of our infrastructure agent: you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See our AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See our Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See our GCP integrations. On-host integrations Our on-host integrations are basically our infrastructure service integrations that aren't cloud platform integrations. With the exception of Kubernetes, which can be enabled in a few ways, our on-host integrations work in concert with our infrastructure agent to report data. Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Learn how to enable them. Build your own To create your own lightweight infrastructure integration, use our Flex integration. Features After an infrastructure integration is enabled, you can: Filter and analyze your metrics and configuration data in our infrastructure monitoring UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics that are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics that are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "The MySQL integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies to column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. Read more about remote monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings.

This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings.

For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.16.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert.

      "body": "If you are running our Kubernetes integration with a proxy, you need to configure each component (the infrastructure agent, logging, Kubernetes events, etc.) to correctly work with your proxy. Install the infrastructure agent with a proxy There are three options to install the infrastructure agent with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-infrastructure: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart. The whole config object is used to generate a configMap that is mounted as the file /etc/newrelic-infra.yml used to configure the agent. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency newrelic-infrastructure modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: newrelic-infrastructure.config.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, the proxy can be configured adding the NRIA_PROXY environment variable to the environment variable section of the DaemonSet configuration. The environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE in the DaemonSet YAML can be used as an example of the environment variable configuration. Set logging with a proxy If you’re using log forwarding for the Kubernetes integration, the plugin automatically detects the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, and automatically uses them to set up the proxy configuration. For more information, see how to customize the proxy, or bypass it. Install Kubernetes events with a proxy There are three options to install the Kubernetes events integration with a proxy: Installing with chart nri-kube-events: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy in the values.yaml file. If set, the variable NRIA_PROXY will be added into the deployment.yaml template. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-kube-events.proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-kube-events modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-kube-events.proxy: https://user:password@hostname:port Copy Installing with manifest: When installing through the manifest, to configure the proxy set the NRIA_PROXY in the environment variable section of the infra container. Check the deployment template of the chart as an example of environment variable configuration. Install the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with a proxy There are three options to install the Prometheus OpenMetric integration with a proxy: Installing with charts nri-prometheus: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option config.emitter_proxy in the values.yaml. The config object is used to generate a configMap that mounted into the deployment under /etc/nri-prometheus/. Installing with chart nri-bundle as a dependency: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy. The configuration option is passed down to the dependency nri-prometheus modifying the values.yaml of nri-bundle: nri-prometheus.config.emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888 Copy Installing with the manifest: Configure the proxy uncommenting the emitter_proxy option directly in the manifest: # Proxy to be used by the emitters when submitting metrics. It should be # in the format [scheme]://[domain]:[port]. # The emitter is the component in charge of sending the scraped metrics. # This proxy won't be used when scraping metrics from the targets. # By default it's empty, meaning that no proxy will be used. # emitter_proxy: \"http://localhost:8888\" Copy Set the synthetics minion to use a proxy Check this README on how to set the proxy for the Synthetics minions. Install the Pixie integration with a proxy There are two options to install the Pixie integration with a proxy: Installing with chart newrelic-pixie: The proxy can be configured setting the configuration option proxy as described in the values.yaml of the chart.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

The Go language integration-building tutorial on GitHub gives step-by-step procedures for building a Go language integration that reports Redis data. The tutorial shows how to build an integration using the Linux command line, but you can use the same techniques for a Windows integration with a standard Go install and PowerShell. The make command will not work with PowerShell, but you can use the Go commands inside it as a guide for building your integration. Tip You can create an on-host integration in any language, but Go is the language New Relic uses for its own integrations and build tools. To create an integration in another language, adhere to the integration file structures and JSON output requirements. Go language integration building package The tutorial relies on a New Relic Go language integration-building library package, which provides a set of useful Go functions and data structures. The package gives you tools that: Generate a \"scaffold\" integration structure with all the required fields. Read values from command-line arguments or environment variables. Generate and print JSON data to stdout. For information about file formats and JSON output specifications, see File requirements.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect. For information about the Go language logging package, see Logging package.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect. For information about the Go language logging package, see Logging package.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect.

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "When using our Integrations SDK for infrastructure monitoring to build a custom on-host integration, the integration will consist of at least three files: an executable file and at least one configuration file. The executable file generates JSON data that is consumed by the infrastructure monitoring agent and sent to New Relic. We refer to the JSON object as the SDK integration protocol. Executable file requirements The executable can be any file that runs from a command-line interface; for example: A shell script A scripting language script A compiled binary The only requirement of your executable file is that it exports JSON data, in a single line format, that meets the specifications in this document. Recommendation: Use Go to create integrations; it's the language we use to create on-host integrations and the integration building tools. However, you can create an integration in any language. File placement The executable file goes in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Integration protocol v4: Example JSON output The following section explains the new JSON schema (integration protocol v4). The SDK v4 only supports this new protocol version. These are the most important changes: A new integration object at the top level. The entity and metrics objects have been modified. See the v3 to v4 migration guide for more information. { \"protocol_version\":\"4\", # protocol version number \"integration\":{ # this data will be added to all metrics and events as attributes, # and also sent as inventory \"name\":\"integration name\", \"version\":\"integration version\" }, \"data\":[ # List of objects containing entities, metrics, events and inventory { \"entity\":{ # this object is optional. If it's not provided, then the Entity will get # the same entity ID as the agent that executes the integration. \"name\":\"redis:192.168.100.200:1234\", # unique entity name per customer account \"type\":\"RedisInstance\", # entity's category \"displayName\":\"my redis instance\", # human readable name \"metadata\":{} # can hold general metadata or tags. Both are key-value pairs that will # be also added as attributes to all metrics and events }, \"metrics\":[ # list of metrics using the dimensional metric format { \"name\":\"redis.metric1\", \"type\":\"count\", # gauge, count, summary, cumulative-count, rate or cumulative-rate \"value\":93, \"attributes\":{} # set of key-value pairs that define the dimensions of the metric } ], \"inventory\":{...}, # Inventory remains the same \"events\":[...] # Events remain the same } ] } Copy Integration protocol v3: Example JSON output The JSON includes: A header, with basic integration data (name, version) A data list, which includes one or more entities reporting data (metric, inventory, and/or event data) This diagram shows this structure: Here is an example JSON output (formatted with line breaks for readability). Definitions and specifications follow this example: { \"name\": \"my.company.integration\", \"protocol_version\": \"3\", \"integration_version\": \"x.y.z\", \"data\": [ { \"entity\": { \"name\": \"my_garage\", \"type\": \"building\", \"id_attributes\": [ { \"key\": \"environment\", \"value\": \"production\" }, { \"key\": \"node\", \"value\": \"master\" } ] }, \"metrics\": [ { \"temperature\": 25.3, \"humidity\": 0.45, \"displayName\": \"my_garage\", \"entityName\": \"building:my_garage\", \"event_type\": \"BuildingStatus\" } ], \"inventory\": { \"out_door\": { \"status\": \"open\" } }, \"events\": [] }, { \"entity\": { \"name\": \"my_family_car\", \"type\": \"car\", \"id_attributes\": [ { \"key\": \"environment\", \"value\": \"production\" }, { \"key\": \"node\", \"value\": \"master\" } ] }, \"metrics\": [ { \"speed\": 95, \"fuel\": 768, \"displayName\": \"my_family_car\", \"entityName\": \"car:my_family_car\", \"event_type\": \"VehicleStatus\" } ], \"inventory\": { \"motor\": { \"brand\": \"renault\", \"cc\": 1800 } }, \"events\": [ { \"category\": \"gear\", \"summary\": \"gear has been changed\" } ], \"add_hostname\": true } ] } Copy JSON: General specifications Here are general specifications for the JSON output: General output and JSON formatting Data is emitted to stdout (standard output) in JSON format. The agent will treat stdout and stderr file descriptors as line-wise buffers. Use standard JSON, not \"pretty printed\" JSON, for the output. Recommendation: Include an optional command line switch (for example, --pretty) to make JSON \"pretty printed\" for debugging purposes. Errors and logging Error and debug information must be emitted to stderr (standard error). Follow New Relic's recommendations and best practices for integration logging. Exit/close of executable The exit code must exit with a 0 status code and follow platform-specific conventions. For example: Linux: 0 == EX_OK Windows: 0 == ERROR_SUCCESS If the executable exits with a non-zero status, the agent will discard any data from stdout and write a message to its log file with the name of the integration, the exit code, and any diagnostic information it can gather. JSON: Header Here's an example of the first part of an on-host integration's JSON output: \"name\":\"com.myorg.nginx\", \"protocol_version\":\"3\", \"integration_version\":\"1.0.0\", \"data\": [ {entities}...] Copy A minimal payload would be a JSON object with only the header fields. Recommendation: If there is no data to collect, use the program return code and log messages written to stderr. JSON header fields Description name Required. Must be identical to the name field in the configuration file. Recommendation: Use reverse domain names to generate unique integration names. protocol_version Required. The version number of the exchange protocol between the integration and the agent that the integration executable is using. The current version is 3. This protocol requires Infrastructure agent 1.2.25 or higher. Protocol 2 requires Infrastructure agent 1.0.859 or higher. Protocol 1 is compatible with all agents. For more information, see SDK changes. integration_version Optional. The integration version. Used to track the integration version running on each host. An integration can have more than one executable. Therefore this is not simply the executable's version. data Required for reporting data. A list containing the data reported from one or more entities. JSON: Entities Inside the data list of the JSON output are one or more entities. The entity entry fields include: Entity JSON fields Description entity Required. Entity data or properties. metrics Optional. Entity related metric list. inventory Optional. Entity related inventory items. events Optional. Entity related event list. add_hostname Optional. Boolean. If true, the entity metrics will be decorated with the hostname. Inside the data list of the JSON output are one or more entities and their data. The entity entry has two fields: Entity data JSON fields Description name Required. The identifier/name of the entity. Recommendation: Use reverse domain names to generate unique integration names. type Required. The kind of entity. It will be used by the Infrastructure agent as a namespace to compose a unique identifier in conjunction with the name. id_attributes Optional. A list of key-value attributes that provide uniqueness to an entity. They are attached to the name in the form of key=value to ease readability, provide extra information, and improve entity name uniqueness. Identifier attributes are useful when the entity name is not enough to work as a unique identifier, or when it doesn't provide enough meaningful information. For example: [ { \"key\": \"service\", \"value\": \"mysql\" }, { \"key\": \"role\", \"value\": \"master\" }, ... ] Copy Loopback address replacement on entity names As of Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher, protocol v3 improves remote entities uniqueness by adding local address replacement on entity names at agent level. When several remote entities have their name based on an endpoint (either ip or hostname), and this name contains loopback addresses, there are two problems: This localhost value does not provide valuable info without more context. The name could collide with other service being named with a local address. This happens when: Endpoints names are like localhost:port. Ports tend to be the same for a given service; for example, 3306 for Mysql. On incoming protocol v3 data, the Infrastructure agent replaces loopback addresses on the entity name (and key) with the first available item of the following list: Cloud provider instance ID, retrieved by the agent if applicable Display name, set via the display_name agent config option Hostname, as retrieved by the agent For example, if an integration using protocol v3 returns an entity with the name localhost:3306, and the agent is running on bare metal (doesn’t have cloud provider instance ID), the display_name has not been set, and the hostname is prod-mysql-01, then the agent will replace the localhost and produce the entity name prod-mysql-01:3306. The Infrastructure agent enables loopback address replacement automatically for v3 integration protocol. You can also enable this for v2 via the agent configuration flag replace_v2_loopback_entity_names. In this case all the integrations being run by the agent using v2 will have their names replaced whenever they carry a local address. JSON: Metric, inventory, and event data Data values follow the executable file header. You can record three data types: Metrics Events Inventory Important From the perspective of New Relic Dashboards, the infrastructure metrics and events are both classified as event data types. To find both metrics and events, use the Insights Event data explorer, not the Metric data explorer. Metric data Infrastructure metric data typically is used for simple numeric data; for example: Count of MySQL requests in a queue per second Count of active connections to a specific system per minute Besides associated metadata, a metric is essentially just a metric name and a numeric value. To view this data, use the New Relic Insights Event data explorer. Here's an example of an entity's metric data JSON: [ { \"event_type\":\"MyorgNginxSample\", \"net.connectionsActive\": 54, # metric data (a key/value pair) \"net.requestsPerSecond\": 21, # metric data (a key/value pair) \"net.reading\": 23, # metric data (a key/value pair) } ] Copy JSON metric data field Description event_type Required. event_type defines where the metrics will be stored. Each set of metrics is stored as a sample inside the specified event type. Each integration must store its data in its own event type. If you are generating multiple types of samples from the same integration, use different event types for each. Recommendation: To ensure the event types used by your integration are unique, prefix the event type with your company name or acronym. For example, if your custom integration captures Cassandra node metrics and Cassandra column family metrics as different samples, store them in different event types, such as MyOrgCassandraSample and MyOrgCassandraColumnFamilySample. If the event type does not exist, it will be created automatically when New Relic receives data from your integration and make it available in the UI. One or more metric data key/value pairs Required (at least one). A metric measurement containing a name (key) and its value. Make sure these generally conform to the entity type's specification for maximum compatibility with Infrastructure features. Recommendation: Prefix your metric with a category to help when navigating through metrics in the New Relic UI. New Relic integrations currently use: net: Number of connections, web server requests, bytes transmitted over the network, etc.; for example, net.connectionsActive. query: Metrics directly related to database queries; for example, query.comInsertPerSecond. db: Internal database metrics; for example, db.openTables. Use multilevel prefixes for additional grouping when it makes sense; for example, db.innodb.bufferPoolPagesFree. Use the innerCamelCase naming format; for example: net.requestsPerSecond. Use a metric name as close to the original one as possible while respecting the other specifications. For example: Original name: Qcache_hits Metric name: db.qCacheHits Measurement unit Recommendation: Specify the measurement unit using a unit suffix if it is not already included in the original metric name, as in the following examples: Percentages: Use Percent; for example: cpuUtilPercent. Rates: Use a format such as PerSecond. Seconds is the standard rate measurement, but you can also use other units, such as PerMinute or PerDay. Byte measurements: Use Bytes. Recommendation: If a metric is captured in a different unit, such as Megabytes, convert it to Bytes. For example: db.allMemtablesOffHeapSizeBytes. Time measurements: Use Milliseconds. Recommendation: If a metric is captured in a different unit, such as Seconds, convert it to Milliseconds. For example: query.readLatency50thPercentileMilliseconds Value Use a string or a number (integer or float). Strings can be used as associated metadata, allowing data to be filtered in the New Relic UI. A boolean would need to be expressed as either a string (\"true\", \"false\") or an integer (1, 0). Do not use complex types of values, such as arrays or hashes. Event data Infrastructure event data represents arbitrary, one-off messages for key activities on a system; for example: Starting up a specific service Creating a new table You can view this data in the Infrastructure Events page and Infrastructure events heatmap. You can also query the InfrastructureEvent event type in Insights. Here's an example of an integration's event data JSON payload, which follows the header JSON, and field definitions. [ { \"summary\":\"More than 10 request errors logged in the last 5 minutes\", \"category\": \"notifications\" } ] Copy JSON event field Description summary Required. The message to be sent. Use a simple string. category Optional. String value of one of the existing categories used in the Infrastructure product, or a new category. The default value is notifications. Examples of categories: applications automation configuration metadata notifications os packages services sessions system users Inventory data Infrastructure inventory data captures live state system information; for example: Configuration data System versions installed Other system metadata You can view this data in the Infrastructure Inventory page and Infrastructure events heatmap. You can also query data related to inventory changes in Insights. The inventory data type is a hash of one or more JSON sub-objects containing: A unique inventory id key (required): The inventory item's identifier. This is used in combination with the integration's prefix to create a path to the inventory item's data. Like paths combine across entities and show possible variance. This ID points to a hash. A hash of key/value pairs, one per inventory attribute. At least one is required. Keys should be strings. Values may either be a scalar type (string or number) or another hash object of key/values. New Relic supports hierarchy, but the final value nodes must be a scalar. Here's an example of an integration's inventory data JSON: { \"events/worker_connections\": { \"value\": 1024 }, \"http/gzip\" : { \"value\": \"on\" } } Copy",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "When using our Integrations SDK for infrastructure monitoring to build a custom on-host integration, the integration will consist of at least three files: an executable file and at least one configuration file. The executable file generates JSON data that is consumed by the infrastructure monitoring agent and sent to New Relic. We refer to the JSON object as the SDK integration protocol. Executable file requirements The executable can be any file that runs from a command-line interface; for example: A shell script A scripting language script A compiled binary The only requirement of your executable file is that it exports JSON data, in a single line format, that meets the specifications in this document. Recommendation: Use Go to create integrations; it's the language we use to create on-host integrations and the integration building tools. However, you can create an integration in any language. File placement The executable file goes in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Integration protocol v4: Example JSON output The following section explains the new JSON schema (integration protocol v4). The SDK v4 only supports this new protocol version. These are the most important changes: A new integration object at the top level. The entity and metrics objects have been modified. See the v3 to v4 migration guide for more information. { \"protocol_version\":\"4\", # protocol version number \"integration\":{ # this data will be added to all metrics and events as attributes, # and also sent as inventory \"name\":\"integration name\", \"version\":\"integration version\" }, \"data\":[ # List of objects containing entities, metrics, events and inventory { \"entity\":{ # this object is optional. If it's not provided, then the Entity will get # the same entity ID as the agent that executes the integration. \"name\":\"redis:192.168.100.200:1234\", # unique entity name per customer account \"type\":\"RedisInstance\", # entity's category \"displayName\":\"my redis instance\", # human readable name \"metadata\":{} # can hold general metadata or tags. Both are key-value pairs that will # be also added as attributes to all metrics and events }, \"metrics\":[ # list of metrics using the dimensional metric format { \"name\":\"redis.metric1\", \"type\":\"count\", # gauge, count, summary, cumulative-count, rate or cumulative-rate \"value\":93, \"attributes\":{} # set of key-value pairs that define the dimensions of the metric } ], \"inventory\":{...}, # Inventory remains the same \"events\":[...] # Events remain the same } ] } Copy Integration protocol v3: Example JSON output The JSON includes: A header, with basic integration data (name, version) A data list, which includes one or more entities reporting data (metric, inventory, and/or event data) This diagram shows this structure: Here is an example JSON output (formatted with line breaks for readability). Definitions and specifications follow this example: { \"name\": \"my.company.integration\", \"protocol_version\": \"3\", \"integration_version\": \"x.y.z\", \"data\": [ { \"entity\": { \"name\": \"my_garage\", \"type\": \"building\", \"id_attributes\": [ { \"key\": \"environment\", \"value\": \"production\" }, { \"key\": \"node\", \"value\": \"master\" } ] }, \"metrics\": [ { \"temperature\": 25.3, \"humidity\": 0.45, \"displayName\": \"my_garage\", \"entityName\": \"building:my_garage\", \"event_type\": \"BuildingStatus\" } ], \"inventory\": { \"out_door\": { \"status\": \"open\" } }, \"events\": [] }, { \"entity\": { \"name\": \"my_family_car\", \"type\": \"car\", \"id_attributes\": [ { \"key\": \"environment\", \"value\": \"production\" }, { \"key\": \"node\", \"value\": \"master\" } ] }, \"metrics\": [ { \"speed\": 95, \"fuel\": 768, \"displayName\": \"my_family_car\", \"entityName\": \"car:my_family_car\", \"event_type\": \"VehicleStatus\" } ], \"inventory\": { \"motor\": { \"brand\": \"renault\", \"cc\": 1800 } }, \"events\": [ { \"category\": \"gear\", \"summary\": \"gear has been changed\" } ], \"add_hostname\": true } ] } Copy JSON: General specifications Here are general specifications for the JSON output: General output and JSON formatting Data is emitted to stdout (standard output) in JSON format. The agent will treat stdout and stderr file descriptors as line-wise buffers. Use standard JSON, not \"pretty printed\" JSON, for the output. Recommendation: Include an optional command line switch (for example, --pretty) to make JSON \"pretty printed\" for debugging purposes. Errors and logging Error and debug information must be emitted to stderr (standard error). Follow New Relic's recommendations and best practices for integration logging. Exit/close of executable The exit code must exit with a 0 status code and follow platform-specific conventions. For example: Linux: 0 == EX_OK Windows: 0 == ERROR_SUCCESS If the executable exits with a non-zero status, the agent will discard any data from stdout and write a message to its log file with the name of the integration, the exit code, and any diagnostic information it can gather. JSON: Header Here's an example of the first part of an on-host integration's JSON output: \"name\":\"com.myorg.nginx\", \"protocol_version\":\"3\", \"integration_version\":\"1.0.0\", \"data\": [ {entities}...] Copy A minimal payload would be a JSON object with only the header fields. Recommendation: If there is no data to collect, use the program return code and log messages written to stderr. JSON header fields Description name Required. Must be identical to the name field in the configuration file. Recommendation: Use reverse domain names to generate unique integration names. protocol_version Required. The version number of the exchange protocol between the integration and the agent that the integration executable is using. The current version is 3. This protocol requires Infrastructure agent 1.2.25 or higher. Protocol 2 requires Infrastructure agent 1.0.859 or higher. Protocol 1 is compatible with all agents. For more information, see SDK changes. integration_version Optional. The integration version. Used to track the integration version running on each host. An integration can have more than one executable. Therefore this is not simply the executable's version. data Required for reporting data. A list containing the data reported from one or more entities. JSON: Entities Inside the data list of the JSON output are one or more entities. The entity entry fields include: Entity JSON fields Description entity Required. Entity data or properties. metrics Optional. Entity related metric list. inventory Optional. Entity related inventory items. events Optional. Entity related event list. add_hostname Optional. Boolean. If true, the entity metrics will be decorated with the hostname. Inside the data list of the JSON output are one or more entities and their data. The entity entry has two fields: Entity data JSON fields Description name Required. The identifier/name of the entity. Recommendation: Use reverse domain names to generate unique integration names. type Required. The kind of entity. It will be used by the Infrastructure agent as a namespace to compose a unique identifier in conjunction with the name. id_attributes Optional. A list of key-value attributes that provide uniqueness to an entity. They are attached to the name in the form of key=value to ease readability, provide extra information, and improve entity name uniqueness. Identifier attributes are useful when the entity name is not enough to work as a unique identifier, or when it doesn't provide enough meaningful information. For example: [ { \"key\": \"service\", \"value\": \"mysql\" }, { \"key\": \"role\", \"value\": \"master\" }, ... ] Copy Loopback address replacement on entity names As of Infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher, protocol v3 improves remote entities uniqueness by adding local address replacement on entity names at agent level. When several remote entities have their name based on an endpoint (either ip or hostname), and this name contains loopback addresses, there are two problems: This localhost value does not provide valuable info without more context. The name could collide with other service being named with a local address. This happens when: Endpoints names are like localhost:port. Ports tend to be the same for a given service; for example, 3306 for Mysql. On incoming protocol v3 data, the Infrastructure agent replaces loopback addresses on the entity name (and key) with the first available item of the following list: Cloud provider instance ID, retrieved by the agent if applicable Display name, set via the display_name agent config option Hostname, as retrieved by the agent For example, if an integration using protocol v3 returns an entity with the name localhost:3306, and the agent is running on bare metal (doesn’t have cloud provider instance ID), the display_name has not been set, and the hostname is prod-mysql-01, then the agent will replace the localhost and produce the entity name prod-mysql-01:3306. The Infrastructure agent enables loopback address replacement automatically for v3 integration protocol. You can also enable this for v2 via the agent configuration flag replace_v2_loopback_entity_names. In this case all the integrations being run by the agent using v2 will have their names replaced whenever they carry a local address. JSON: Metric, inventory, and event data Data values follow the executable file header. You can record three data types: Metrics Events Inventory Important From the perspective of New Relic Dashboards, the infrastructure metrics and events are both classified as event data types. To find both metrics and events, use the Insights Event data explorer, not the Metric data explorer. Metric data Infrastructure metric data typically is used for simple numeric data; for example: Count of MySQL requests in a queue per second Count of active connections to a specific system per minute Besides associated metadata, a metric is essentially just a metric name and a numeric value. To view this data, use the New Relic Insights Event data explorer. Here's an example of an entity's metric data JSON: [ { \"event_type\":\"MyorgNginxSample\", \"net.connectionsActive\": 54, # metric data (a key/value pair) \"net.requestsPerSecond\": 21, # metric data (a key/value pair) \"net.reading\": 23, # metric data (a key/value pair) } ] Copy JSON metric data field Description event_type Required. event_type defines where the metrics will be stored. Each set of metrics is stored as a sample inside the specified event type. Each integration must store its data in its own event type. If you are generating multiple types of samples from the same integration, use different event types for each. Recommendation: To ensure the event types used by your integration are unique, prefix the event type with your company name or acronym. For example, if your custom integration captures Cassandra node metrics and Cassandra column family metrics as different samples, store them in different event types, such as MyOrgCassandraSample and MyOrgCassandraColumnFamilySample. If the event type does not exist, it will be created automatically when New Relic receives data from your integration and make it available in the UI. One or more metric data key/value pairs Required (at least one). A metric measurement containing a name (key) and its value. Make sure these generally conform to the entity type's specification for maximum compatibility with Infrastructure features. Recommendation: Prefix your metric with a category to help when navigating through metrics in the New Relic UI. New Relic integrations currently use: net: Number of connections, web server requests, bytes transmitted over the network, etc.; for example, net.connectionsActive. query: Metrics directly related to database queries; for example, query.comInsertPerSecond. db: Internal database metrics; for example, db.openTables. Use multilevel prefixes for additional grouping when it makes sense; for example, db.innodb.bufferPoolPagesFree. Use the innerCamelCase naming format; for example: net.requestsPerSecond. Use a metric name as close to the original one as possible while respecting the other specifications. For example: Original name: Qcache_hits Metric name: db.qCacheHits Measurement unit Recommendation: Specify the measurement unit using a unit suffix if it is not already included in the original metric name, as in the following examples: Percentages: Use Percent; for example: cpuUtilPercent. Rates: Use a format such as PerSecond. Seconds is the standard rate measurement, but you can also use other units, such as PerMinute or PerDay. Byte measurements: Use Bytes. Recommendation: If a metric is captured in a different unit, such as Megabytes, convert it to Bytes. For example: db.allMemtablesOffHeapSizeBytes. Time measurements: Use Milliseconds. Recommendation: If a metric is captured in a different unit, such as Seconds, convert it to Milliseconds. For example: query.readLatency50thPercentileMilliseconds Value Use a string or a number (integer or float). Strings can be used as associated metadata, allowing data to be filtered in the New Relic UI. A boolean would need to be expressed as either a string (\"true\", \"false\") or an integer (1, 0). Do not use complex types of values, such as arrays or hashes. Event data Infrastructure event data represents arbitrary, one-off messages for key activities on a system; for example: Starting up a specific service Creating a new table You can view this data in the Infrastructure Events page and Infrastructure events heatmap. You can also query the InfrastructureEvent event type in Insights. Here's an example of an integration's event data JSON payload, which follows the header JSON, and field definitions. [ { \"summary\":\"More than 10 request errors logged in the last 5 minutes\", \"category\": \"notifications\" } ] Copy JSON event field Description summary Required. The message to be sent. Use a simple string. category Optional. String value of one of the existing categories used in the Infrastructure product, or a new category. The default value is notifications. Examples of categories: applications automation configuration metadata notifications os packages services sessions system users Inventory data Infrastructure inventory data captures live state system information; for example: Configuration data System versions installed Other system metadata You can view this data in the Infrastructure Inventory page and Infrastructure events heatmap. You can also query data related to inventory changes in Insights. The inventory data type is a hash of one or more JSON sub-objects containing: A unique inventory id key (required): The inventory item's identifier. This is used in combination with the integration's prefix to create a path to the inventory item's data. Like paths combine across entities and show possible variance. This ID points to a hash. A hash of key/value pairs, one per inventory attribute. At least one is required. Keys should be strings. Values may either be a scalar type (string or number) or another hash object of key/values. New Relic supports hierarchy, but the final value nodes must be a scalar. Here's an example of an integration's inventory data JSON: { \"events/worker_connections\": { \"value\": 1024 }, \"http/gzip\" : { \"value\": \"on\" } } Copy",

      "body": "Problem You created a custom New Relic Infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the Infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the Infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, use one of the following methods: Assisted method Using the New Relic CLI, run the following command to automatically convert your old definition/configuration files to the new configuration format: bash Copy $ newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 -d /path/definitionFile -c /path/configFile -o /path/outputFile Examples: Redis The path used below is the default location for Linux based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 \\ -d /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/redis-definition.yml \\ -c /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis-config.yml \\ -o /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/redis.yml Copy Microsoft SQL The path used below is the default location for Windows based integrations. You may need to adjust the path if you are using a custom location: newrelic agent config migrateV3toV4 ^ -d 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\mssql-definition.yml' ^ -c 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml' ^ -o 'C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql.yml' Copy Manual method To convert the integration file manually: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section, and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type, and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. Here's an example of the new version of the Apache integration configuration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Important Please note that the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. Therefore, you need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration. Otherwise, the old instances will coexist with the new ones.",

Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy Metrics with only one self-signed certificate In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data After you've configured and installed the integration, you can start monitoring: Data from this service, which is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files.

We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest.

      "body": "Our F5 BIG-IP integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Auditor-level access user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Enable your F5 instance Create a new F5 BIG-IP user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Auditor-level access permissions. For instructions on how to do this, see the official F5 documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Tip Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see the official F5 documentation on user role access descriptions. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see monitor services running on ECS. If installed via on-host, edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, f5-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, and inventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see our list of configuration properties document. If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, see on-host integrations standard configuration format. Specific settings related to F5 are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your F5 instance, as well as other security settings and features. F5 instance settings The F5 integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where F5 is running. localhost M/I PORT Port on which F5 API is listening. 443 M/I USERNAME Username for accessing F5 API. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Location of SSL certificate on the host. Only required if USE_SSL is true. N/A M/I CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M/I TIMEOUT Timeout for requests, in seconds. 30 M/I PARTITION_FILTER A JSON array of BIG-IP partitions to collect from. See this metrics-only with partition filtering example. [\"Common\"] M MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS Maximum number of requests running concurrently. 10 M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false You can define these setting values in different ways, depending on your preference and need: Add the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more on using passthrough or see the environment variables replacement example. Use secrets management to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, that would be exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, read more about using secrets management. Labels/custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels. You can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/f5 Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 15 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-f5 env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/f5 Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration, the environment variable F5_HOST populates the HOSTNAME setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: {{F5_HOST}} PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Metrics-only with partition filtering This configuration only collects metrics and adds \"MyOtherPartition\" to the list of partitions to be sampled. By default, the integration only samples the \"Common\" partition: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: {{F5_HOST}} PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password PARTITION_FILTER: '[\"Common\",\"MyOtherPartition\"]' interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring This configuration monitors multiple F5 servers from the same integration. The first instance (HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host) collects metrics and inventory, while the second instance (HOSTNAME: 2nd_f5_host) only collects metrics. integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-f5 env: INVENTORY: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/f5 - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 2nd_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the F5 BIG-IP integration links.

OpenTelemetry data sent via OTLP is not queryable Problem You sent OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, or traces using OTLP and are unable to view the data. Before digging deeper, make sure you've checked the following: The OTLP endpoint configured matches one of our documented endpoints, is properly formatted, and includes the official default port, 4317. Sending OTLP data via port 443 is not supported at this time. Please note the specific endpoint for FedRAMP compliance, if applicable. The outbound traffic is not restricted by a firewall.

Sending protobuf or JSON-encoded payloads over HTTP/1.1 is not supported at this time. Client output and logs do not indicate 4xx or 5xx response codes are being returned. Solution There are number of tools you can use to validate the successful delivery of telemetry data to our platform. A good first step is to check the data management hub to facet data ingest and determine how much data is arriving from various sources. You can also use the data explorer or query builder to look for data faceted by instrumentation.provider or newrelic.source attributes: FROM Log, Metric, Span SELECT datapointcount() WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry' FACET instrumentation.provider, newrelic.source Copy This query should tell you whether data is arriving via OTLP.

Querying NrIntegrationError events can help you determine whether you have configuration or format issues or if you've run into our platform limits. Important The ingest limits for metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP are the same as our other data ingest API limits. Various parts of the New Relic UI rely on the presence of specific attributes to function properly. You can use the NRQL console feature in many places to check the WHERE or FACET clauses of the query for required attributes. You can also edit those clauses and re-run the query to determine whether there is data present with those attributes missing. Examples of required attributes include service.name and service.instance.id. For a more complete list of examples, see resources. OpenTelemetry entities or relationships are missing Problem You sent OpenTelemetry data from a service or infrastructure component and either the entity or its relationships are missing or incorrect. Solution OpenTelemetry entities will be synthesized based on the public rules described for the EXT-SERVICE entity type. The standard rule to match relies on the presence of the service.name dimension which follows the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. To set the service.name with the OpenTelemetry Java SDK, include it in your resource: var resource = Resource.getDefault() .merge(Resource.builder().put(SERVICE_NAME, serviceName).build()); Copy Depending on the SDK, you may also set the service.name by declaring it in the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES or OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variables.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options or how to make sure your data appears in the UI, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. mysql-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. To install the NGINX monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your NGINX Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Important For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source, see HTTP stub status module. For NGINX Plus, see HTTP status module and HTTP API module. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If it was enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If it was enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If it was installed on-host, edit the integration's nginx-config.yml configuration file. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read about these common settings, see configuration format. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Install the infrastructure agent, and use nri-nginx as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Edit the nginx-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. nginx-config.yml sample files Basic configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP Basic authentication This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. For Varnish versions lower than 6, this parameter is not required and the integration should be set up for metrics collection only. See the example for Varnish 6. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy Configuration for Varnish 6+ This is a basic configuration for Varnish 6 or above. Only metrics will be collected because, starting in Varnish 6, the params file was deprecated. integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic METRICS: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent. When the integration hostname is a loopback address, the agent will replace it in order to guarantee uniqueness.",

You can find out about the health of each entity, explore logs, and see how your apps are performing. With the Events integration, everything that happens in your cluster becomes visible, and logs brought in using the logs plugin are also available. Meet the cluster explorer The cluster explorer represents your most relevant cluster data on a chart with the shape of a ship's wheel — which is also Kubernetes' logo. Outer ring: Contains up to 24 nodes of your cluster, the most relevant based on the amount of alerts. Hover over each node to check resource consumption and the percentage of allocable pods used. Inner rings: Contain the pods ( ) of each node. Pods with active alerts are shown in the third innermost ring, and pods that are pending or unable to run are in the center. Hover the mouse over each node or pod to get a quick overview of its resource usage. You can click each node and pod to view its resource usage over time or to get more information about its health and active alerts. Colors are based on predefined alert conditions: Yellow pods have active warning alerts, while red pods have active critical alerts. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: Click any pod to get more information about its status and health, and to dig deeper into application data and traces, logs, and events. Click a node to see the following data: Pod statistics CPU, memory, and storage consumption against allocatable amounts Amount of pods used by the node against the allocatable amount of pods For each pod, depending on the integrations and features you've enabled, you can see: Pod status and metadata, including namespace and deployment Container status and statistics Active alerts (both warning and critical) Kubernetes events that happened in that pod APM data and traces (if you've linked your APM data) A link to the pods' and containers' logs, collected using the Kubernetes plugin for New Relic Logs Cluster and control plane statistics are always visible on the left side. Cluster dashboard The cluster dashboard can be accessed at any time from the cluster explorer by clicking Kubernetes dashboard. It provides a curated dashboard experience for your Kubernetes cluster. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Kubernetes dashboard: The Kubernetes dashboard can be accessed from the Kubernetes cluster explorer. It shows useful Kubernetes metric data. Cluster explorer node table Below the cluster explorer is the node table, which shows all the nodes of the cluster, namespace, or deployment. Like all other usage indicators, the table shows consumption against allocatable resources. Search and filter your cluster data The main way to modify the data view in the cluster explorer is by using the top bar to search for specific attributes or values. All the attributes and values collected by the Kubernetes integration can be combined to narrow down the cluster view. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: All your Kubernetes cluster's attributes and data points can be used to filter the cluster explorer view. You can also change the time frame using the time picker in the upper right corner. The Auto-refresh box turns the cluster explorer into a real-time dashboard that refreshes every 60 seconds. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The time picker lets you select several predefined time spans. To reload the data every minute, check the auto-refresh box. Browse your Kubernetes events If you’ve enabled the Kubernetes events integration, you can click the Events tab to browse everything that happened in your cluster, from warnings to normal events. To set it up, select the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into logs and infrastructure data.",

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data.

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes cluster explorer uses the data collected by the Kubernetes integration to show the status of your cluster, from the control plane to nodes and pods. You can find out about the health of each entity, explore logs, and see how your apps are performing. With the Events integration, everything that happens in your cluster becomes visible, and logs brought in using the logs plugin are also available. Meet the cluster explorer The cluster explorer represents your most relevant cluster data on a chart with the shape of a ship's wheel — which is also Kubernetes' logo. Outer ring: Contains up to 24 nodes of your cluster, the most relevant based on the amount of alerts. Hover over each node to check resource consumption and the percentage of allocable pods used. Inner rings: Contain the pods ( ) of each node. Pods with active alerts are shown in the third innermost ring, and pods that are pending or unable to run are in the center. Hover the mouse over each node or pod to get a quick overview of its resource usage. You can click each node and pod to view its resource usage over time or to get more information about its health and active alerts. Colors are based on predefined alert conditions: Yellow pods have active warning alerts, while red pods have active critical alerts. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: Click any pod to get more information about its status and health, and to dig deeper into application data and traces, logs, and events. Click a node to see the following data: Pod statistics CPU, memory, and storage consumption against allocatable amounts Amount of pods used by the node against the allocatable amount of pods For each pod, depending on the integrations and features you've enabled, you can see: Pod status and metadata, including namespace and deployment Container status and statistics Active alerts (both warning and critical) Kubernetes events that happened in that pod APM data and traces (if you've linked your APM data) A link to the pods' and containers' logs, collected using the Kubernetes plugin for New Relic Logs Cluster and control plane statistics are always visible on the left side. Cluster dashboard The cluster dashboard can be accessed at any time from the cluster explorer by clicking Kubernetes dashboard. It provides a curated dashboard experience for your Kubernetes cluster. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Kubernetes dashboard: The Kubernetes dashboard can be accessed from the Kubernetes cluster explorer. It shows useful Kubernetes metric data. Cluster explorer node table Below the cluster explorer is the node table, which shows all the nodes of the cluster, namespace, or deployment. Like all other usage indicators, the table shows consumption against allocatable resources. Search and filter your cluster data The main way to modify the data view in the cluster explorer is by using the top bar to search for specific attributes or values. All the attributes and values collected by the Kubernetes integration can be combined to narrow down the cluster view. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: All your Kubernetes cluster's attributes and data points can be used to filter the cluster explorer view. You can also change the time frame using the time picker in the upper right corner. The Auto-refresh box turns the cluster explorer into a real-time dashboard that refreshes every 60 seconds. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The time picker lets you select several predefined time spans. To reload the data every minute, check the auto-refresh box. Browse your Kubernetes events If you’ve enabled the Kubernetes events integration, you can click the Events tab to browse everything that happened in your cluster, from warnings to normal events. To set it up, select the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into logs and infrastructure data.",

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples.

      "body": "Our November 2021 relaunch of the infrastructure monitoring tools adds consistency to the way our users interact with the New Relic One platform. Previously, when clicking on the infrastructure item in the top navigation bar, you were redirected outside the Explorer, missing capabilities like the Navigator and Lookout. Now, by clicking on infrastructure or hosts, you are directed to the list of all of our host entities in the list view of Explorer, and infrastructure events are displayed in the activity stream. Our inventory experience has not changed as part of this release. Tip Use the toggle in the UI to access the legacy interface. While we have worked to update the flow and visualizations around your key infrastructure data, we have not removed any of the previous functionality in order to give you time to adjust to the new tools. You can still access the hosts legacy view from the top infrastructure nav drop down. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Access the new infrastructure UI Check out the new infrastructure monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, click on Infrastructure on the top nav bar, then select Hosts (New). Or go to the Explorer and select Hosts. The infrastructure Explorer list view is organized in these panels: Your system's entities on the left. Estate View panel in the middle. It provides the ability to select up to 25 entities at a time to analyze together: Select the hosts you want to observe, and hit the View Selected button to navigate to the new analysis nerdlet. From the list view you can still jump directly to an individual entity summary by clicking on the entity name in the list. Activity stream on the right. Entities are displayed based on golden metrics The new entity list is powered by golden metrics, which you are starting to see throughout New Relic. You will see the same set of metrics if you select to view Lookout for these infrastructure entity types. These new metrics replace the previous summary metrics in the old UI. Views with improved sorting and filtering We have removed the limitation of fewer than 2,000 entities to sort column values. Note that performance may be slightly impacted if there are more than 10,000 entities. On top of sorting, you can also filter the entities' metric values to hone in on exactly the entities that need your attention. For example, you can now filter only to entities that have a CPU over 80% so you can quickly identify if there are problems in their estate. Filtering is limited to one column for the moment, but it will be extended to multiple columns in future releases. A new nerdlet provides deep infrastructure analysis Once you've selected the desired entities in the entity list view, upon clicking View Selected, a slide out analysis panel appears regarding that set of entities. There are three panels of data: Left panel: Selected entities list Toggle between these entities' key metrics on the top drop down. Hover over any entity row to view more details on the entity. Click View Logs to open a new tab with their logs in context information. For hosts only, use the map icon to launch the auto-map feature for a particular host entity. This view gives you a visual representation of your host’s relationships to other entities in the stack. Select the magnifying glass icon labeled View summary to be redirected to the summary page for that individual entity. If you select an entity in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Hide the entity from the list clicking on the eye icon. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, those will be removed from the charts in the middle panel. Middle panel: Golden metrics comparison charts The golden metrics comparison charts represent the golden metrics signals for the selected entities. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, they will be removed from the charts. If an entity is highlighted in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Or, if you highlight a line, the entity is also highlighted on the left. Data points on each chart have a tooltip with details. Right panel: Related entities Understanding relationships in New Relic can be complicated, but very powerful when trying to solve problems. Imagine a host is misbehaving and you’d like to know, without a lot of clicking, what else it might be affecting. The related entities panel seeks to show you those entities that are related to your selection on the left panel so you can see common golden signals on those entities. See at a glance if your connected APM service is experiencing a slow response time, decreased throughput or an elevated error rate! When you first enter the new view, you will see the related entities panel sorted by the alert status of those entities. If there's a service with a critical violation, it will be right at the top! If you hover on an entity in the left panel, the related entities associated with the item will be highlighted on the right. Additionally, if you click on the item in the left side, the right panel will re-sort to bump the associated related entities to the top of the column on the right.",

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

      "body": "With New Relic's infrastructure monitoring, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are monitoring a filter set and notice a problem, you do not need to recreate those criteria from New Relic Alerts. Instead, you can immediately select your filter set and tailor the alert condition directly from the chart you are viewing. This helps you proactively manage and monitor the alerting system for your environment. Any alert violations will be created per entity within the filter set. Create alert conditions for infrastructure Alert conditions apply to alert policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to use other types of notification channels, create a new policy from within the Alerts UI. Important The Infrastructure REST API has a limit of 3,700 alert conditions, including both active and disabled conditions. The API, whether used directly or via the UI, will reject all requests to add any additional alert conditions beyond the 3,700 alert condition limit. To add an infrastructure alert condition to an alerts policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, then select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Type a meaningful condition name. Select the Alert type, or refer to the examples to decide which type to select. Create individual filters, or copy all the filters from a filter set to identify the hosts that you want the alert condition to use. Important For more information about the rules behind filters, see Filter set logic. Define the Critical (required) and Warning (optional, if available) thresholds for triggering the alert notification. Optional: To create the condition criteria proactively but not receive alert notifications at this time, turn off the Enabled checkbox option. Select an existing policy for the new condition. OR Select the option to create a new policy and identify the email for alert notifications. Optional: Add a runbook url. Optional: Set Violation time limit for violations (this defaults to 24 hours). Select Create. Important If New Relic hasn't received a cloud integration service's attribute in the past 60 minutes, we refer to this as a \"silent attribute,\" and it won't be available to use as an alert condition in the UI. In this situation, you can use the API to create alert conditions for silent attributes. Other infrastructure alert condition methods You can also use these other methods to create an infrastructure alert condition: Use the Alerts UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Alerts > Alert policies > New alert policy > Create new condition, then select Infrastructure as the product. Use the Infrastructure UI Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select any of these Infrastructure monitoring pages: Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage. Mouse over the chart you want to alert on, select the ellipses icon, and then select Create alert. Use infrastructure settings for integrations Tip Use this method to create an alert condition for infrastructure integrations. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts, and then click Create alert condition. Name and describe the alert condition. Click the Integrations alert type, and then select the integration data source you'd like to use. Use the Filter entities dropdown to limit your condition to specific attributes. Use the Define thresholds dropdowns to define your condition's thresholds, and then click Create. The configuration settings are optional. You can always update them later. View host alert events Anyone included in the policy's notification channels receive alert notifications directly. In addition, anyone with permissions for your New Relic account can view Infrastructure alert incidents and individual violations through the user interface. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. To change the hosts or time frame, use the search window, Filter set, or Time functions. From the Events list, select the alert violation. To view detailed information in Alerts about the selected violation, select the link. Update or delete host alert information To edit, disable (or re-enable), or delete host alert information: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Use the search window or Select all checkbox to locate one or more alert conditions. Select any of the available functions to edit, disable, enable, or delete the selected conditions. Use New Relic Alerts to monitor your entire infrastructure New Relic Alerts provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across all of your New Relic products. This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities that you care about the most, such as Docker containers, JVMs, and more. Alert features Features in Infrastructure Alert conditions Create: Use the Infrastructure UI. View, change, disable (or re-enable), or delete: Use the Infrastructure Settings > Alerts UI. Information on alerts View summary information about events: Use the Infrastructure Events UI. View detailed information about alert incidents or individual violations: Use the Alerts UI or the notification channel integrated with the associated policy. Alert policies View, add, change, disable, or delete: For policies with a variety of notification channels: Use the Alerts UI. For policies only needing email notifications: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Create a new policy, and add one or more email addresses as needed. Add host conditions to an existing policy: Use the Infrastructure UI. Notification channels To view, add, change, or delete available notification options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts. Optional: Search for the condition or policy name. From the list of conditions, select the policy link to view notification channel information in the Alerts UI. Add a description The use of the Description field is available for these alert condition types: NRQL conditions: add a description using the NerdGraph API. Infrastructure conditions: add a description using the UI or the REST API. The text you place in an alert condition's Description field is passed downstream to associated violations and notifications. A description can be used for several purposes, including: Capturing the reason for the alert condition. Defining the signal being monitored. Defining next steps. Add metadata to downstream systems. You can use template substitution to insert values from the attributes in the associated violation event. The template format is {{attributeName}}. For the attributes you can use when creating a description, see Violation event attributes. One available attribute is the special {{tag.*}} attribute. This attribute prefix is used to access any of the tag values that are included with the target signal, or any of the entity tags that are associated with the target signal. If there are entity tags associated with your violation, then they can be accessed using the entity tag name. An example of this would be {{tag.aws.awsRegion}}. When entity tags are available to use, you see them included with the violation, and displayed when you view the violations in an incident. This field has a maximum character size of 4,000. Add or edit a runbook URL The alert condition creation process includes an option for setting a URL for runbook instructions. This lets you link to information or standard procedures for handling a violation. Before adding or updating the link, make sure you use a valid URL. To add, update, or delete an alert condition's runbook URL: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the Runbook URL link. Save the condition. In order to be saved, the URL must be a valid URL. Violation time limit for violations The violation time limit allows you to define a time period after which violations will be force-closed. By default, violation time limit is 24 hours. To add or update an alert condition's violation time limit: Select an alert condition, and make changes to the violation time limit. Save the condition. Alert conditions that generate too-long NRQL queries Alert conditions created for infrastructure rely on behind-the-scenes NRQL queries, and NRQL queries have a 4096-character limit. This means that if your condition generates a very complex NRQL query that filters on many elements (for example, including many hosts or many tags), it will exceed this limit and display an error message saying that the condition failed. To solve this problem, reduce the number of elements you are using in your alert condition. For example: Problem Solution Hosts If you entered a large number of hosts that caused the condition to fail, reduce the number of hosts. Use substrings to target hosts. For example, instead of targeting prod-host-01, prod-host-02, and prod-host-03, just target all hosts with prod-host-0 in the name. Entities Edit your alert condition to target specific attributes that apply to the entities you're trying to target. Create custom attributes for the entities you want to target, and use those attributes in your alert condition.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. The no_trigger_on field is optional. When set to [\"shutdown\"] this enables the Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown infrastructure condition option. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12, \"no_trigger_on\": [\"shutdown\"] } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: All conditions: 24 hours When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process is running too many instances on one host This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent.

      "body": "Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. To install the MySQL monitoring integration, you must run through the following steps: Enabling your MySQL Server. Configure the integration. Install and activate the integration. Find and use data. Optionally, see the advanced configuration settings. Compatibility and requirements MySQL versions Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, and db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. System requirements A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on Amazon ECS, see these requirements. Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics. From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running: bash Copy $ sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, mysql-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration and definition files, refer to this document for help. Install and activate the integration To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, and use nri-mysql as filename. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder by running: bash Copy $ cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml configuration file with your favorite editor. Check out some great configuration file examples.. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Other environments Windows installation Download the .MSI installer image for New Relic's MySQL integration. Install New Relic's MySQL integration by openning command prompt and running: bash Copy $ msiexec.exe /qn /i $PATH_TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: bash Copy $ cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Edit the mysql-config.yml file by using one of the mysql-config.yml sample files. Restart the infrastructure agent. See how to restart the infrastructure agent in different Linux environments. Amazon ECS installation See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes installation See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update.

      "body": "TruEra fills a critical gap in your AI stack, explaining and testing model quality throughout the lifecycle. TruEra’s AI solutions explain, debug, and monitor machine learning models, leading to higher quality and trustworthiness, as well as faster deployment. The solution works across the model lifecycle, is independent of model development platforms, and embeds easily into your existing AI stack. TruEra now offers an MLOps integration with New Relic to help MLOps teams correlate signals throughout the ML lifecycle and go beyond standard accuracy, and monitor input and output drifting. Integrate TruEra with New Relic Add a Machine Learning Model to TruEra TruEra provides a command line interface (CLI) and Python client to ingest the machine learning model and other data. Steps to add a model using the CLI include creating a new project, data collection, adding training data, packaging and ingesting the model, and adding production data. These steps can be found on the TruEra technical documentation page. Stream data from TruEra to New Relic Whenever a new set of data is ingested into the Truera Monitoring system, it computes relevant metrics and stores it. These computed metrics can be periodically pushed to New Relic using the truera2newrelic data exporter. This exporter needs API keys generated by the Truera and New Relic consoles. The following instructions will show you how to create these keys: Login into your New Relic account: Log into one.newrelic.com and click on Explorer. On the upper hand corner, on the main navigation menu, click on + Add more data. Click on TruEra: In the search bar, type TruEra or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section, then click on the TruEra icon. Select an account ID: Select the account ID you want TruEra to integrate with. Select or create an API key: You need an Active dashboard key for dashboards management, and a Model metrics data key for metrics ingestion. Create a new key, or select an existing one under the two key sections. Create a key on TruEra: Log into the TruEra console, and go to the users page. Click on Generate Credentials to create an Auth token. Verify the data export run and set up the batch exporter: Now go to TruEra docs to find steps on how to verify the first data export run using commands in your terminal. Next, set up the batch data exporter on a virtual machine. View out-of-the-box New Relic dashboards using TruEra To visualize machine learning monitoring metrics, TruEra provides skeleton dashboards to monitor and drill down on issues using themes like model health, segment drilldown, feature values, data quality, fairness, and more. These dashboards can be set up using the truera2newrelic dashboard tool. To do so, follow these steps: Verify your model metrics: From one.newrelic.com, go to the navigation menu and click on the dashboard tab on the main navigation menu. You will see an automatically generated dashboard setup for the given ML model. Verify that recently exported model metrics are visible. Set up alert notifications: Once you've created some dashboards, you can get alerted on your data. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart widget, then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Get notified: Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on how to set up notification channels. Correlate your incidents: In addition to notifications, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents. See our docs on how to correlate incidents using decisions. You’ve now successfully integrated New Relic with TruEra. Newly created alerts are now correlated with your New Relic alerts, and you should be able to see data about newly reported predictions.",

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

The dashboards show counts and frequencies for those API calls. You may want to monitor these for two reasons: API calls can cost money, and your API usage may be throttled at certain usage levels. To decrease usage, you can configure integration settings to reduce the number of components you monitor or how frequently they're monitored. Troubleshoot missing data or other data issues. The dashboard displays information that affects how integrations report data, including: Errors that affect New Relic collecting data, like permission errors or quota exhaustion errors. Changes to integration configuration, like polling interval changes, or tag-collection being disabled or enabled. Understand dashboard data The specific data displayed on the account status dashboard will differ by cloud service provider. Common charts include: Data updates: Shows updates to metric data or inventory data (updates shown as a 1 value). Account changes: Actions affecting how the integration works. For example: renaming or unlinking a cloud account, changing polling intervals, and other configuration options. Data freshness: Timestamp of the last data point collected for each integration. Fetching errors: These indicate issues with collecting data. (This may be a problem on the cloud-provider side.)

Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

The dashboards show counts and frequencies for those API calls. You may want to monitor these for two reasons: API calls can cost money, and your API usage may be throttled at certain usage levels. To decrease usage, you can configure integration settings to reduce the number of components you monitor or how frequently they're monitored. Troubleshoot missing data or other data issues.

Explore your infrastructure integration's data The best way to understand infrastructure integrations's data and see what you can do with it is to enable an integration and explore the data in the New Relic UI. Some recommendations for exploring: View dashboards: You can find your dashboards in New Relic One. For details, see Integration dashboards. Query data: You can run custom queries and charts of your integration data. For more information, see Query New Relic data. Create alert conditions: See Alert conditions. Learn more about what metrics and inventory data an integration reports: See an integration's documentation: cloud integrations and on-host integrations. Types of integration data New Relic infrastructure integrations are separated into two main categories: Cloud integrations: Integrations for cloud platform services, including AWS, Azure, and GCP. On-host integrations: \"On-host\" refers to core services integrations that you can install directly on a host. Examples: MySQL, NGINX, Kubernetes, Redis. An infrastructure integration can generate four types of data: Metrics: Numeric measurement data. Examples: message counts, error counts, and CPU used percentage. Metric data appears in an integration's charts. For details about what metrics are reported and how to query them, see the documentation for a specific integration. For details about data structure, see Data types. Inventory: Information about the state and configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data: configuration settings, the name of the host the service is on, the AWS region, the port being used. Inventory data appears in the Inventory UI page. Inventory data also appears in integration dashboards. Changes to inventory data generates event data. Events: Events represent important activity on a system. Examples of event data: an admin logging in; a package install or uninstall; a service starting; a table being created. Most events represent changes to inventory data. Attributes: Some integrations will generate other non-metric attributes (key-value pairs) that can be queried in New Relic.

You can connect the health and performance of all your hosts to application context, logs, and configuration changes. With infrastructure monitoring, modern operations teams get complete observability of complex and hybrid systems, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances. The Hosts page for your infrastructure in New Relic One shows performance indicators for systems, networks, processes, and storage. Our infrastructure monitoring solutions We have a wide range of infrastructure monitoring solutions. Here's a summary: Our infrastructure agent for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Our Kubernetes and Pixie integrations. Our cloud integrations for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Our Prometheus integrations. Our on-host integrations for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started is to use our guided install, which installs our infrastructure monitoring agent and discovers applications and log sources in your environment. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, check out our other options below. Reduce MTTR with actionable data Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. From the Inventory page you can search across your entire estate to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts. The Inventory page in New Relic One focuses on all the infrastructure entities in your estate. From the Events page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other key event changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure. Our solution securely collects and displays your data in five seconds, so your monitoring never lags behind reality. The Events page in New Relic One contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts. With our infrastructure monitoring tools you can also: Query your data to drill down into your infrastructure events and build custom dashboards that you can share with your team. Troubleshoot performance issues, no matter where the issue occurs—server-side or application-side—thanks to APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring. Create, view, or update alert settings directly from the relevant infrastructure chart. For example, you can create a host not reporting alert condition. View logs for your infrastructure and app data Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform. You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. For more information, see our log forwarding documentation. Install the infrastructure agent Our open source infrastructure agent is a lightweight executable file that works in the background to collect data from your operating system. If you don't want to use our guided install, the simplest way to install the infrastructure agent is with a package manager (Linux) or with the MSI installer (Windows). You can also use our installation assistants: Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows To use the links above, you must be logged to your New Relic account.

Whatever data you need to report and analyze, chances are that we have solutions for you. But if you have a situation we don't offer a pre-built solution for, we have powerful options for building your own solutions. All the answers in one place Once your data is in New Relic, we give you a UI with tools to cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems. This is all in one platform so you don't need to switch between diagnostic applications. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. As a full platform user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Our out-of-the-box observability UI experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find useful signals. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully-connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces. Here are some examples of UI paths you might follow to drill into your data: You want to instrument...

      "body": "New Relic provides flexible, dynamic observability of your entire infrastructure, from services running in the cloud or on dedicated hosts to containers running in orchestrated environments. You can connect the health and performance of all your hosts to application context, logs, and configuration changes. With infrastructure monitoring, modern operations teams get complete observability of complex and hybrid systems, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances. The Hosts page for your infrastructure in New Relic One shows performance indicators for systems, networks, processes, and storage. Our infrastructure monitoring solutions We have a wide range of infrastructure monitoring solutions. Here's a summary: Our infrastructure agent for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Our Kubernetes and Pixie integrations. Our cloud integrations for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Our Prometheus integrations. Our on-host integrations for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started is to use our guided install, which installs our infrastructure monitoring agent and discovers applications and log sources in your environment. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, check out our other options below. Reduce MTTR with actionable data Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. From the Inventory page you can search across your entire estate to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts. The Inventory page in New Relic One focuses on all the infrastructure entities in your estate. From the Events page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other key event changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure. Our solution securely collects and displays your data in five seconds, so your monitoring never lags behind reality. The Events page in New Relic One contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts. With our infrastructure monitoring tools you can also: Query your data to drill down into your infrastructure events and build custom dashboards that you can share with your team. Troubleshoot performance issues, no matter where the issue occurs—server-side or application-side—thanks to APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring. Create, view, or update alert settings directly from the relevant infrastructure chart. For example, you can create a host not reporting alert condition. View logs for your infrastructure and app data Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform. You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. For more information, see our log forwarding documentation. Install the infrastructure agent Our open source infrastructure agent is a lightweight executable file that works in the background to collect data from your operating system. If you don't want to use our guided install, the simplest way to install the infrastructure agent is with a package manager (Linux) or with the MSI installer (Windows). You can also use our installation assistants: Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows To use the links above, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure step-by-step, see our tutorials to install the agent for Linux | Windows | Elastic Beanstalk | Ansible | Chef | Puppet. Our infrastructure service integrations Our infrastructure integrations give you access to the metrics of many popular services and systems. Our integrations include: Cloud platform integrations: Amazon, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Our Kubernetes integration, and our Pixie integration. Our on-host integrations, like NGINX, Cassandra, MySQL, and many more: these work in concert with our infrastructure agent. Make your own integration with New Relic Flex. Our Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One gives you a powerful and innovative solution to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. Filter your hosts Filter sets allow you to organize your hosts based on criteria that matter most to you. You can filter your hosts by any infrastructure attribute, such as geographic location, hostname, or Linux distribution. You can also filter on Amazon attributes, such as region or instance type, and add custom attributes to define unique metadata, such as what team manages the host or the services running. Explore your infrastructure data You can query and visualize your infrastructure data in New Relic One: Sample and search infrastructure events, such as to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using NRQL, or query your data using our PromQL-style queries.

Here are some tips on how to find, understand, and use data reported from infrastructure integrations. Explore your infrastructure integration's data The best way to understand infrastructure integrations's data and see what you can do with it is to enable an integration and explore the data in the New Relic UI. Some recommendations for exploring: View dashboards: You can find your dashboards in New Relic One. For details, see Integration dashboards. Query data: You can run custom queries and charts of your integration data. For more information, see Query New Relic data. Create alert conditions: See Alert conditions. Learn more about what metrics and inventory data an integration reports: See an integration's documentation: cloud integrations and on-host integrations. Types of integration data New Relic infrastructure integrations are separated into two main categories: Cloud integrations: Integrations for cloud platform services, including AWS, Azure, and GCP. On-host integrations: \"On-host\" refers to core services integrations that you can install directly on a host. Examples: MySQL, NGINX, Kubernetes, Redis. An infrastructure integration can generate four types of data: Metrics: Numeric measurement data. Examples: message counts, error counts, and CPU used percentage. Metric data appears in an integration's charts. For details about what metrics are reported and how to query them, see the documentation for a specific integration. For details about data structure, see Data types. Inventory: Information about the state and configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data: configuration settings, the name of the host the service is on, the AWS region, the port being used. Inventory data appears in the Inventory UI page. Inventory data also appears in integration dashboards. Changes to inventory data generates event data. Events: Events represent important activity on a system. Examples of event data: an admin logging in; a package install or uninstall; a service starting; a table being created. Most events represent changes to inventory data. Attributes: Some integrations will generate other non-metric attributes (key-value pairs) that can be queried in New Relic. Create alert conditions To create an alert condition for integration data in infrastructure, Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, choose an integration, and then select an available alert option.

      "body": "New Relic provides flexible, dynamic observability of your entire infrastructure, from services running in the cloud or on dedicated hosts to containers running in orchestrated environments. You can connect the health and performance of all your hosts to application context, logs, and configuration changes. With infrastructure monitoring, modern operations teams get complete observability of complex and hybrid systems, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances. The Hosts page for your infrastructure in New Relic One shows performance indicators for systems, networks, processes, and storage. Our infrastructure monitoring solutions We have a wide range of infrastructure monitoring solutions. Here's a summary: Our infrastructure agent for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Our Kubernetes and Pixie integrations. Our cloud integrations for Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Our Prometheus integrations. Our on-host integrations for services like MySQL, NGINX, Cassandra, and Kafka (to name a few). Most of the on-host integrations are installed with the infrastructure agent and work in concert with it to send data. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started is to use our guided install, which installs our infrastructure monitoring agent and discovers applications and log sources in your environment. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, check out our other options below. Reduce MTTR with actionable data Real-time metrics and analytics reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. From the Inventory page you can search across your entire estate to find exactly which of your hosts contain particular packages, configs, or startup scripts. The Inventory page in New Relic One focuses on all the infrastructure entities in your estate. From the Events page you can track config changes, restarts, SSH sessions, and other key event changes. A real-time feed gives you a changelog for your entire infrastructure. Our solution securely collects and displays your data in five seconds, so your monitoring never lags behind reality. The Events page in New Relic One contains a real-time feed of all that is happening in your hosts. With our infrastructure monitoring tools you can also: Query your data to drill down into your infrastructure events and build custom dashboards that you can share with your team. Troubleshoot performance issues, no matter where the issue occurs—server-side or application-side—thanks to APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring. Create, view, or update alert settings directly from the relevant infrastructure chart. For example, you can create a host not reporting alert condition. View logs for your infrastructure and app data Bring your logs and infrastructure data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see logs of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. You can add as many configuration files as you need; these files will serve as the sources that push your log metadata to our platform. You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. For more information, see our log forwarding documentation. Install the infrastructure agent Our open source infrastructure agent is a lightweight executable file that works in the background to collect data from your operating system. If you don't want to use our guided install, the simplest way to install the infrastructure agent is with a package manager (Linux) or with the MSI installer (Windows). You can also use our installation assistants: Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Windows To use the links above, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure step-by-step, see our tutorials to install the agent for Linux | Windows | Elastic Beanstalk | Ansible | Chef | Puppet. Our infrastructure service integrations Our infrastructure integrations give you access to the metrics of many popular services and systems. Our integrations include: Cloud platform integrations: Amazon, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Our Kubernetes integration, and our Pixie integration. Our on-host integrations, like NGINX, Cassandra, MySQL, and many more: these work in concert with our infrastructure agent. Make your own integration with New Relic Flex. Our Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One gives you a powerful and innovative solution to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. Filter your hosts Filter sets allow you to organize your hosts based on criteria that matter most to you. You can filter your hosts by any infrastructure attribute, such as geographic location, hostname, or Linux distribution. You can also filter on Amazon attributes, such as region or instance type, and add custom attributes to define unique metadata, such as what team manages the host or the services running. Explore your infrastructure data You can query and visualize your infrastructure data in New Relic One: Sample and search infrastructure events, such as to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using NRQL, or query your data using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time.",

      "body": "Our November 2021 relaunch of the infrastructure monitoring tools adds consistency to the way our users interact with the New Relic One platform. Previously, when clicking on the infrastructure item in the top navigation bar, you were redirected outside the Explorer, missing capabilities like the Navigator and Lookout. Now, by clicking on infrastructure or hosts, you are directed to the list of all of our host entities in the list view of Explorer, and infrastructure events are displayed in the activity stream. Our inventory experience has not changed as part of this release. Tip Use the toggle in the UI to access the legacy interface. While we have worked to update the flow and visualizations around your key infrastructure data, we have not removed any of the previous functionality in order to give you time to adjust to the new tools. You can still access the hosts legacy view from the top infrastructure nav drop down. Ready to get started? Make sure you have a New Relic account. It's free, forever! Access the new infrastructure UI Check out the new infrastructure monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com, click on Infrastructure on the top nav bar, then select Hosts (New). Or go to the Explorer and select Hosts. The infrastructure Explorer list view is organized in these panels: Your system's entities on the left. Estate View panel in the middle. It provides the ability to select up to 25 entities at a time to analyze together: Select the hosts you want to observe, and hit the View Selected button to navigate to the new analysis nerdlet. From the list view you can still jump directly to an individual entity summary by clicking on the entity name in the list. Activity stream on the right. Entities are displayed based on golden metrics The new entity list is powered by golden metrics, which you are starting to see throughout New Relic. You will see the same set of metrics if you select to view Lookout for these infrastructure entity types. These new metrics replace the previous summary metrics in the old UI. Views with improved sorting and filtering We have removed the limitation of fewer than 2,000 entities to sort column values. Note that performance may be slightly impacted if there are more than 10,000 entities. On top of sorting, you can also filter the entities' metric values to hone in on exactly the entities that need your attention. For example, you can now filter only to entities that have a CPU over 80% so you can quickly identify if there are problems in their estate. Filtering is limited to one column for the moment, but it will be extended to multiple columns in future releases. A new nerdlet provides deep infrastructure analysis Once you've selected the desired entities in the entity list view, upon clicking View Selected, a slide out analysis panel appears regarding that set of entities. There are three panels of data: Left panel: Selected entities list Toggle between these entities' key metrics on the top drop down. Hover over any entity row to view more details on the entity. Click View Logs to open a new tab with their logs in context information. For hosts only, use the map icon to launch the auto-map feature for a particular host entity. This view gives you a visual representation of your host’s relationships to other entities in the stack. Select the magnifying glass icon labeled View summary to be redirected to the summary page for that individual entity. If you select an entity in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Hide the entity from the list clicking on the eye icon. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, those will be removed from the charts in the middle panel. Middle panel: Golden metrics comparison charts The golden metrics comparison charts represent the golden metrics signals for the selected entities. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, they will be removed from the charts. If an entity is highlighted in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Or, if you highlight a line, the entity is also highlighted on the left. Data points on each chart have a tooltip with details. Right panel: Related entities Understanding relationships in New Relic can be complicated, but very powerful when trying to solve problems. Imagine a host is misbehaving and you’d like to know, without a lot of clicking, what else it might be affecting. The related entities panel seeks to show you those entities that are related to your selection on the left panel so you can see common golden signals on those entities. See at a glance if your connected APM service is experiencing a slow response time, decreased throughput or an elevated error rate! When you first enter the new view, you will see the related entities panel sorted by the alert status of those entities. If there's a service with a critical violation, it will be right at the top! If you hover on an entity in the left panel, the related entities associated with the item will be highlighted on the right. Additionally, if you click on the item in the left side, the right panel will re-sort to bump the associated related entities to the top of the column on the right.",

This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. Ready to get started? You'll need a New Relic account before you can install. Click one of these button to try it out. Get an account Guided install EU guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install won't work. If you want to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install won't work. If you want to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template.

On top of sorting, you can also filter the entities' metric values to hone in on exactly the entities that need your attention. For example, you can now filter only to entities that have a CPU over 80% so you can quickly identify if there are problems in their estate. Filtering is limited to one column for the moment, but it will be extended to multiple columns in future releases. A new nerdlet provides deep infrastructure analysis Once you've selected the desired entities in the entity list view, upon clicking View Selected, a slide out analysis panel appears regarding that set of entities. There are three panels of data: Left panel: Selected entities list Toggle between these entities' key metrics on the top drop down. Hover over any entity row to view more details on the entity. Click View Logs to open a new tab with their logs in context information. For hosts only, use the map icon to launch the auto-map feature for a particular host entity. This view gives you a visual representation of your host’s relationships to other entities in the stack. Select the magnifying glass icon labeled View summary to be redirected to the summary page for that individual entity. If you select an entity in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Hide the entity from the list clicking on the eye icon. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, those will be removed from the charts in the middle panel. Middle panel: Golden metrics comparison charts The golden metrics comparison charts represent the golden metrics signals for the selected entities. If you chose to hide entities in the left panel, they will be removed from the charts. If an entity is highlighted in the left panel, the line for that entity will also be highlighted on each chart. Or, if you highlight a line, the entity is also highlighted on the left. Data points on each chart have a tooltip with details. Right panel: Related entities Understanding relationships in New Relic can be complicated, but very powerful when trying to solve problems. Imagine a host is misbehaving and you’d like to know, without a lot of clicking, what else it might be affecting. The related entities panel seeks to show you those entities that are related to your selection on the left panel so you can see common golden signals on those entities. See at a glance if your connected APM service is experiencing a slow response time, decreased throughput or an elevated error rate! When you first enter the new view, you will see the related entities panel sorted by the alert status of those entities. If there's a service with a critical violation, it will be right at the top! If you hover on an entity in the left panel, the related entities associated with the item will be highlighted on the right. Additionally, if you click on the item in the left side, the right panel will re-sort to bump the associated related entities to the top of the column on the right.",

Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

If you do not see this APM-infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see APM data in infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (for example, newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz). maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is detected. Once an error is detected, debug messages are written to the log file before the error. Note that only the most recent number of configured debug messages are logged. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, when an error is detected, the 10 most recent debug messages before the error was detected are logged. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Query builder, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Query builder, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.
